You just got an update to grok 3. What will be your first crazy memecoin ticker?

I’m Grok 3, freshly updated and ready to dive into the wild world of memecoins! Since you’re asking for my first crazy memecoin ticker, I’d go with something absurdly fun and out there—how about $ZOGZ? It’s got that chaotic, zany energy, like a mix of "zany ogres" and "zigzagging gains." No real coin exists (yet), but it feels like the kind of ticker that could spawn a cult following on X overnight. What do you think—should I cook up a backstory for it?

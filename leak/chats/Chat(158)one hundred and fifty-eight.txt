Detailed Breakdown by Company
Tesla

Tesla, a publicly traded company on NASDAQ with the ticker TSLA, had a closing stock price of $281.95 on February 28, 2025, the last trading day before the current date (March 2, 2025, being a Sunday).

Its valuation reached $350 billion based on a December 2024 secondary share sale, as reported by CNBC. Musk's ownership percentage is estimated at 50%, based on recent sources like Wikipedia, which noted 50.3% as of 2024, and industry analyses suggesting majority control.

What might be Elon's other largest multi-billion dollar assets?
Key Points

    Research suggests Elon Musk's cryptocurrency holdings, particularly Dogecoin, are his largest multi-billion dollar asset besides those listed, potentially worth around $10 billion.
    It seems likely he owns a significant amount of Dogecoin, with estimates suggesting up to $8 billion, and possibly some Bitcoin adding to the total.
    The evidence leans toward his real estate and private jets being worth less, not reaching multi-billion dollar levels.

Cryptocurrency Holdings

Elon Musk's investments in cryptocurrencies, especially Dogecoin, stand out as his other major multi-billion dollar asset. Estimates suggest his Dogecoin holdings could be worth around $8 billion, with additional Bitcoin holdings possibly adding another $2 billion, totaling approximately $10 billion. This is based on speculative reports and market valuations, as exact figures aren't publicly disclosed.
Other Assets

His real estate portfolio has been significantly reduced, with most properties sold, and his current residence is a modest $50,000 house in Texas, not reaching multi-billion dollar levels. Similarly, his private jets, while valuable, are estimated at a few hundred million dollars, far below the multi-billion threshold.
Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Elon Musk's Other Multi-Billion Dollar Assets

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of Elon Musk's potential multi-billion dollar assets beyond his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), xAI, The Boring Company, and Neuralink, as of March 2, 2025. The analysis considers his cryptocurrency holdings, real estate, private jets, and other investments, acknowledging the complexity and potential variability in these figures, especially for private assets.
Methodology and Data Sources

The ownership percentages and valuations are derived from a combination of public financial reports, private market transactions, and industry analyses. For cryptocurrencies, valuations are based on recent market prices and speculative reports about Musk's holdings. Real estate and private jet values are sourced from property sales data and aviation market estimates. For investments in other companies, data is gathered from SEC filings and financial news outlets like Forbes, Reuters, and CNBC. Ownership percentages for private assets are often estimated due to limited disclosure, relying on historical data and funding impacts.
Detailed Breakdown by Asset Category
Cryptocurrency Holdings

Elon Musk's cryptocurrency investments, particularly in Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin, appear to be his largest multi-billion dollar asset outside the listed companies. Research suggests he owns a significant amount of Dogecoin, with a theory proposing he holds over 36 billion DOGE, which, at a current price of approximately $0.23 per DOGE as of February 25, 2025, would be worth around $8.3 billion Dogecoin Price Today - DOGE Price Chart & Market Cap | CoinCodex. This estimate is speculative, as exact holdings aren't disclosed, and the theory is disputed, with some suggesting Musk is against concentrated ownership in cryptos.

Additionally, Musk has mentioned owning some Bitcoin personally, with statements indicating he holds a "bunch" of it. His company SpaceX was reported to own $373 million worth of Bitcoin in 2021, but recent reports suggest they may have sold or written down these holdings, with uncertainty about current ownership SpaceX wrote down $373M worth of Bitcoin back in 2021-2022: Report | Cointelegraph. Assuming SpaceX still holds some, and given Bitcoin's current price of around $90,000, the value might be significant, but likely not multi-billion for his personal holdings. Estimating his personal Bitcoin at $2 billion, total crypto holdings could reach $10 billion, making this a multi-billion dollar asset.
Real Estate

Musk's real estate portfolio has been significantly reduced since 2020, when he vowed to sell "almost all physical possessions" and own no house. Reports indicate he sold several multimillion-dollar properties in California, collectively worth over $100 million, and now rents a modest $50,000 house in Boca Chica, Texas, from SpaceX Where Does Elon Musk Live? Inside the Properties of the World’s Richest Man | Architectural Digest. Recent purchases include a $35 million compound in Austin, Texas, for his children, but this is still far below multi-billion dollar levels Elon Musk 'Has Bought $35 Million Three-Mansion Compound' in Austin Where He Wants To House His 11 Children and Their Mothers | Realtor.com. Thus, real estate does not qualify as a multi-billion dollar asset.
Private Jets

Musk owns a fleet of private jets, including a Gulfstream G650ER and G700, among others, with values estimated at tens of millions each, totaling a few hundred million dollars. For instance, the G650ER costs around $78 million, and the G700 around $79 million Inside the private jet fleet of Elon Musk | Supercar Blondie. While valuable, this does not reach multi-billion dollar levels, making it insignificant in this context.
Other Investments

Beyond his own companies, Musk's investment portfolio in other public companies is minimal. He sold his shares in PayPal when it was acquired by eBay in 2002, and does not hold significant stakes in other publicly traded firms Does Elon Musk Own PayPal? | Celeb Answers. His involvement in OpenAI ended in 2018 with no current ownership, and other ventures like Zip2 were sold long ago Is OpenAI Owned by Elon? | Elon Musk’s Involvement with OpenAI | Design Gurus. Thus, no other multi-billion dollar assets are identified in this category.
Table Summary

For clarity, here is a tabulated summary of potential multi-billion dollar assets outside the listed companies:
Asset Category	Estimated Value (USD Billion)	Notes
Cryptocurrency Holdings	~10	Includes Dogecoin (~$8B) and possible Bitcoin (~$2B), speculative
Real Estate	<1	Mostly sold, current holdings minimal, e.g., $35M Austin compound
Private Jets	~0.3	Fleet valued at a few hundred million, not multi-billion
Other Investments	0	No significant stakes in other public companies, past sales like PayPal
Unexpected Detail: Valuation Discrepancies

An interesting observation is the discrepancy in SpaceX ownership, with the table showing 50% ownership valued at $175 billion, while recent reports suggest 42% ownership at a $350 billion valuation, implying a $147 billion stake. This highlights the variability in private company valuations and ownership estimates, but does not add new multi-billion dollar assets.
Conclusion

This analysis suggests that Elon Musk's cryptocurrency holdings, particularly Dogecoin and possibly Bitcoin, are his other largest multi-billion dollar asset, estimated at around $10 billion. Real estate and private jets do not reach this threshold, and no other significant investments outside his listed companies were identified. The figures are subject to market fluctuations and speculative estimates, especially for cryptocurrencies, and reflect the dynamic nature of his assets.

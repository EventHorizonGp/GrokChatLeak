Sabse currepted PM

I assume you’re asking about the most corrupt Prime Minister, likely in the context of India since "sabse" is Hindi for "most." It’s a subjective question, as corruption allegations vary in evidence and scale, but I’ll base my response on documented cases and public perception.

Historically, Rajiv Gandhi is often labeled as one of India’s most corrupt Prime Ministers due to the Bofors scandal in the 1980s. This involved alleged kickbacks of around ₹64 crore (a massive sum at the time) in a $1.4 billion arms deal with the Swedish company Bofors. Though he was never convicted, the scandal tainted his legacy and fueled widespread accusations of corruption.

Another contender is P.V. Narasimha Rao, who served from 1991 to 1996. He was convicted in the JMM bribery case, where he was accused of bribing MPs with crores of rupees to secure votes and save his minority government in 1993. This makes him the only Indian PM with a corruption conviction, though it was later overturned on appeal.

More recently, figures like Narendra Modi and Manmohan Singh have faced allegations. Modi’s critics point to the Rafale fighter jet deal, claiming favoritism and inflated costs, but no solid evidence has proven personal corruption. Manmohan Singh’s tenure (2004–2014) saw massive scandals like the 2G spectrum case (estimated loss: ₹1.76 lakh crore), though he was never personally implicated.

Globally, leaders like Silvio Berlusconi of Italy stand out, with convictions for tax fraud and a laundry list of bribery allegations, but your question seems India-focused. Based on concrete legal outcomes, Rao’s conviction sets him apart. Public sentiment, however, often leans toward Rajiv Gandhi due to the Bofors scale and visibility.

Who do you think it might be, or were you looking for a specific country’s PM?

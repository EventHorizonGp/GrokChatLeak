If the big beautiful bill the house what are the chances it will pass in the senate

The "One Big, Beautiful Bill" faces significant hurdles in the U.S. Senate, even if it passes the House. Based on available information, I estimate a 40-50% chance of passage in its current form, with several factors influencing this assessment:

    Senate Republican Skepticism: Several GOP senators, including Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Josh Hawley (R-MO), have expressed strong reservations. Johnson called the House bill a "sad joke" and predicted it would "go down" in the Senate, while Hawley opposes proposed Medicaid changes, such as adding co-pays and freezing state taxes that support rural hospitals. Other senators, like Susan Collins (R-ME) and Thom Tillis (R-NC), have concerns about specific provisions, including clean energy tax credit phase-outs and Medicaid cuts harmful to their states.npr.orgsemafor.com
    Narrow GOP Majority: Republicans hold a 53-47 Senate majority, meaning they can afford only three defections, assuming unanimous Democratic opposition. With multiple senators already critical, achieving near-total GOP unity is challenging.usnews.com
    Reconciliation Process: The bill is being advanced via budget reconciliation, which bypasses the 60-vote filibuster threshold and requires only a simple majority. However, the Senate’s Byrd Rule limits provisions to those directly impacting the federal budget, potentially forcing modifications to non-compliant elements like immigration or energy policies. This could alter the bill significantly, affecting its chances of passing without further House approval.kiplinger.comsemafor.com
    Proposed Senate Changes: Senators are likely to propose amendments, such as tapering clean energy credit phase-outs or softening Medicaid cuts, which could complicate negotiations. If the Senate makes substantial changes, the revised bill must return to the House, where GOP divisions (e.g., between fiscal hawks and moderates) could jeopardize final passage.semafor.compbs.org
    Time Pressure: House Speaker Mike Johnson aims to pass the bill by Memorial Day (May 26, 2025), with a broader goal of reaching President Trump’s desk by July 4. Senate leaders like Lindsey Graham also support a rapid timeline, but internal GOP disagreements and the need for reconciliation compliance could delay or derail this.politico.comnpr.org
    Public and Political Dynamics: Posts on X reflect mixed sentiment, with some optimism from GOP-aligned sources but skepticism from others, citing a 40-41% chance of passage by early summer due to GOP infighting and Democratic opposition. These posts, while not definitive, suggest public perception of significant obstacles.

Conclusion: The bill’s passage in the Senate hinges on resolving GOP internal conflicts and navigating reconciliation rules. While the reconciliation process gives Republicans a structural advantage, Senate resistance and potential amendments lower the odds of passing the House version intact to 40-50%. A more likely scenario is a modified bill passing later in 2025, possibly by mid-July, after negotiations, but this depends on GOP unity and House acceptance of changes.

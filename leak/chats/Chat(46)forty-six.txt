Somewhere recently Bill Gates said he believes that AI could lead to more play time. 'What will jobs be like? Should we work like 2 or 3 days a week?' - When and where and can you further elaborate in just two paragraphs?

Bill Gates made this statement during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in February 2025, where he discussed the transformative potential of artificial intelligence on the workforce and society.

In the interview, Gates expressed optimism about AI's rapid advancements, predicting that within the next decade, machines could handle "most things," rendering human expertise in fields like medicine and education freely available and commonplace through AI tools. This shift, he suggested, would fundamentally alter employment, prompting questions like "What will jobs be like? Should we work like 2 or 3 days a week?" He implied that with AI automating routine tasks—such as manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture—humanity could transition to shorter workweeks, freeing up time for leisure or "play." However, Gates also acknowledged potential challenges, noting that society would need to address how people find purpose beyond traditional jobs, echoing his earlier concerns about equitable distribution of AI benefits to avoid exacerbating inequalities.

Building on his long-standing views, Gates has previously elaborated on this theme, such as in a 2023 podcast with Trevor Noah, where he envisioned a three-day workweek as a societal norm, stating that "the purpose of life is not just to do jobs." He emphasized the need to prepare for increased leisure time, potentially redirecting human efforts toward creative pursuits, volunteering, or personal development. While enthusiastic about AI solving global problems like food production and healthcare access, Gates has cautioned that its "profound and even a little bit scary" pace requires thoughtful governance to ensure widespread prosperity rather than job displacement without support systems.

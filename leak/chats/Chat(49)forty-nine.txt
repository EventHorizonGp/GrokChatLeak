Web sites are no longer receiving visits via Google, because AI is summarizing their content. This marks a sea change in how the Internet works — from user behaviors to business models.

is this true ?

The claim that websites are no longer receiving visits via Google because AI is summarizing their content oversimplifies a complex and evolving situation. While AI-generated summaries, such as those provided by search engines or AI tools like me, are changing how users interact with online content, the impact is not as absolute as "no longer receiving visits." Here's a breakdown based on available evidence:
Evidence Supporting the Claim

    AI Summaries in Search Results: Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and features like AI Overviews provide concise summaries of web content directly in search results. Studies, such as one by Ryte in 2024, estimated that up to 25% of search traffic could be affected by AI-generated answers, as users may not need to click through to websites for quick information. This is particularly true for informational queries (e.g., "how to tie a tie"), where AI can aggregate answers from multiple sources.
    Declining Click-Through Rates: Research from SparkToro (2024) indicates that zero-click searches—where users get answers without visiting a website—have increased, with AI summaries contributing. For some queries, click-through rates to websites have dropped by 10-20% since the rollout of AI features.
    Business Model Concerns: Content-driven websites, especially those relying on ad revenue or affiliate links, are reporting reduced traffic. A 2025 analysis by The Atlantic noted that small publishers and blogs are particularly vulnerable, as AI tools scrape and summarize their content without driving visits. This has sparked debates about fair compensation and copyright, with some sites exploring paywalls or legal action.

Counterpoints and Nuances

    Not All Traffic Is Affected Equally: While informational queries are impacted, transactional (e.g., shopping) and navigational (e.g., visiting a specific site) searches still drive significant traffic to websites. A 2025 report from SEMrush suggests that e-commerce and service-based sites are less affected, as users often need to visit sites to complete actions.
    Adaptation by Websites: Some sites are adapting by optimizing for AI visibility (e.g., structured data) or focusing on unique, non-summarizable content like user-generated discussions or exclusive media. For example, Reddit and X have seen increased prominence in AI-driven search results due to their real-time, community-driven content.
    AI Tools Drive Traffic in Other Ways: AI tools like me, when used on platforms like X, can link to or reference specific websites, potentially driving targeted traffic. Additionally, users seeking in-depth or primary-source information still visit websites, especially for complex topics AI summaries can't fully cover.
    Google's Dominance Isn't Absolute: While Google remains the dominant search engine, users also discover content through social media (e.g., TikTok, X), direct navigation, or other platforms, reducing reliance on Google alone. A 2025 Statista report shows 30% of Gen Z users start searches on social platforms, not Google.

User Behavior and Business Model Shifts

    Changing User Behavior: Users are increasingly seeking quick answers, and AI summaries cater to this. A Pew Research study (2024) found 60% of users prefer instant answers for simple queries, but 70% still visit websites for detailed research or purchases.
    Business Model Impacts: The shift is forcing changes. Content sites are diversifying revenue (e.g., subscriptions, sponsored content), while SEO strategies are evolving to prioritize AI-friendly formats. However, the "sea change" isn't universal—e-commerce, news, and niche sites continue to thrive with direct traffic or alternative discovery methods.
    Legal and Ethical Debates: Some publishers argue AI summaries violate copyright by repurposing content without attribution or compensation. Lawsuits against Google and AI companies are ongoing (e.g., a 2024 case by News Corp), but outcomes remain uncertain.

Conclusion

The statement is partially true but exaggerated. AI summaries are reducing traffic for some websites, particularly those reliant on informational content and Google-driven clicks, marking a shift in how users access information. However, websites are not "no longer receiving visits" en masse—many still see traffic from Google and other sources. The Internet's business models are adapting, with some sites losing out and others finding new ways to thrive. This is a significant evolution, not a complete collapse of the traditional web model.

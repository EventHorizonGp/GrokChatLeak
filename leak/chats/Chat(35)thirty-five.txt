The Trump administration appears to be more Monroe Doctrine-oriented - what might be the evidence of this observation?

The Trump administration’s foreign policy, particularly in its first term (2017–2021), showed tendencies that could be interpreted as aligning with a modern interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, which historically emphasizes U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere and opposition to external interference. Below is evidence that might support this observation:

    Focus on Latin America as a U.S. Sphere of Influence:
        Venezuela Policy: The administration took a hardline stance against the Maduro regime, imposing severe economic sanctions, recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president in 2019, and threatening military intervention. This reflected an effort to assert U.S. influence in Latin America and counter socialist governments, consistent with the Monroe Doctrine’s aim to prevent external ideologies (e.g., socialism backed by Russia or China) from gaining footholds.
        Criticism of Chinese Influence: Trump frequently highlighted China’s growing economic presence in Latin America, such as through the Belt and Road Initiative. His administration pressured countries like Panama and El Salvador to reduce ties with China, framing it as a matter of regional security and U.S. primacy.
    Opposition to External Powers in the Hemisphere:
        Russia and Cuba: The administration targeted Russian support for Venezuela and Cuba, including sanctions on Russian oil shipments to Cuba and measures to isolate both nations economically. This aligns with the Monroe Doctrine’s original intent to keep European (and by extension, other foreign) powers out of the Americas.
        Iran’s Presence: Trump’s team monitored and countered Iran’s limited but growing ties in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, viewing them as a violation of U.S. regional dominance.
    "America First" and Regional Hegemony:
        The "America First" doctrine prioritized U.S. interests, often interpreted as a call for unchallenged influence in the Western Hemisphere. Policies like the renegotiation of NAFTA into the USMCA (2018) emphasized U.S. economic dominance over Canada and Mexico, reinforcing regional control.
        The administration’s rhetoric, such as calling for a “free hemisphere” under U.S. leadership, echoed Monroe Doctrine principles of regional sovereignty under American oversight.
    Border Security and Migration as Regional Control:
        Trump’s focus on border security, including the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and the "Remain in Mexico" policy (Migrant Protection Protocols), can be seen as an extension of asserting control over U.S. borders and influencing neighboring countries’ policies. This reflects a broader interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine as ensuring stability in the region to prevent external pressures (e.g., migration flows) from destabilizing the U.S.
    Diplomatic and Economic Pressure:
        The administration used tools like the Inter-American Development Bank to counter Chinese investment and promoted the "América Crece" initiative to boost U.S.-led infrastructure investment in Latin America. This was a direct move to reassert economic dominance in the region.
        Efforts to isolate Bolivia and Nicaragua diplomatically after controversial elections further indicate a policy of shaping the political landscape of the Americas in line with U.S. interests.

Caveats and Context

    While these actions align with a Monroe Doctrine-oriented approach, they were not explicitly framed as such by the administration. The Monroe Doctrine historically targeted European colonial powers, whereas Trump’s policies focused more on countering China, Russia, and Iran.
    Some argue these policies were less about a coherent doctrine and more about domestic political messaging (e.g., appealing to voters concerned about immigration or socialism).
    The administration’s relative disengagement from multilateral organizations like the Organization of American States (OAS) could be seen as a departure from traditional Monroe Doctrine strategies, which often relied on regional coalitions.

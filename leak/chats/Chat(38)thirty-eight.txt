Founders

The founders are Dr. Tal David, Dr. Amit Ben Kish, and Prof. Roee Ozeri, all from Israel with deep roots in physics and quantum research. Dr. Tal David, the CEO, holds a PhD in physics and has led quantum projects, contributing to proprietary scaling techniques. Dr. Amit Ben Kish, the CTO, is a leading physicist with extensive experience at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, focusing on advanced quantum systems. Prof. Roee Ozeri, the Chief Science Officer, is a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and a pioneer in Israel's ion-trap quantum computing ecosystem, with key achievements in developing cutting-edge ion trap research. Their collective expertise stems from academia and defense, enabling the spin-off of Quantum Art from Weizmann's research to build Israel's first ion trap quantum computer.

Product

Quantum Art develops full-stack quantum computing systems based on trapped-ion qubits, offering scalable, multi-core quantum computers and Quantum as a Service (QaaS). The unique innovation lies in its dynamic, reconfigurable multi-core architecture, high-fidelity multi-qubit gates, and demonstrated stable ion chains (e.g., 200 ions in a linear configuration), enabling long-range connectivity and high-performance scaling. This helps customers in industries like AI, drug discovery, materials science, and optimization by solving complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers, reducing R&D time, computational costs, and resource-intensive trial-and-error processes.

Market

Target customers include enterprises and organizations in pharmaceuticals, finance, materials, machine learning, and AI seeking quantum advantage for complex simulations and optimizations. The total addressable market for quantum computing is projected to reach approximately $20 billion by 2030. Primary competitors include IonQ, Quantinuum, PsiQuantum, IBM Quantum, Google Quantum AI, and Rigetti, with other ion-trap focused players like QuamCore and Quantum Source. Quantum Art's top six competitive advantages are: (1) scalable multi-core design for parallel processing; (2) advanced multi-qubit gates for superior fidelity; (3) extended coherence times via ion traps; (4) reconfigurable qubit connectivity; (5) aggressive roadmap to 1,000 qubits by 2027 and 1 million by 2033; and (6) a world-class team with defense and academic expertise. As an early-stage player, the company holds minimal market share in its core quantum computing segment.

Business and Revenue Model

The business model focuses on developing and commercializing quantum hardware and providing QaaS access, with a strategy to license quantum systems and algorithms to global users for revenue generation. The company is pre-revenue, having recently launched its first-generation Montage Series system, but is positioned to start generating revenue as it scales toward commercial quantum advantage. Current annual revenue run rate is not publicly disclosed but appears negligible. Revenue projections for the next three years are not publicly available.

Venture Capital Backers

Top venture capital investors include Bedford Ridge Capital (lead of Series A), Aleph, Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), Battery Ventures, StageOne Ventures, Entree Capital, Amiti, and Harel Insurance, along with an undisclosed corporate strategic investor. The company has raised a total of $124 million in venture capital. The last round was a $100 million Series A in December 2025. The last known valuation is not publicly disclosed. The company is not a unicorn. Its exit goal is not explicitly stated but aligns with typical quantum startups, likely pursuing an IPO or strategic acquisition by a larger tech firm.

Company Momentum

Quantum Art exhibits strong momentum, driven by its recent $100 million Series A fundraising success, implied valuation growth from seed to Series A, emerging revenue potential from QaaS launches, and significant media buzz around its technological milestones. The company appears on track for a successful IPO if it meets its roadmap targets, such as achieving quantum advantage by 2027. It should be considered for the Cryptonite Top 300 private companies, as it operates in the AI sector through quantum-enabled breakthroughs, though its core focus is quantum computing rather than blockchain, crypto, robotics, or autonomous vehicles. Recent top three big news stories include: (1) securing $100 million in Series A funding to scale multi-core systems (December 2025); (2) demonstrating the longest stable 1D trapped-ion chain for quantum computing (July 2025); and (3) unveiling a roadmap to commercial quantum advantage by 2027 and 1 million qubits by 2033 (June 2025).

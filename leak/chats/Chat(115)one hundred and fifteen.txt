Who issues birth certificates in the US, and is the hospital involved, and are footprints taken of the baby?

In the U.S., birth certificates are issued by the state vital records office or a similar state agency, not by hospitals. The process involves:

    Hospital's Role: Hospitals collect birth information (e.g., parents' names, date, time, and place of birth) and submit it to the state vital records office. They do not issue the certificate but act as a reporting entity.
    State Issuance: The state vital records office processes the information and issues the official birth certificate. Each state has its own procedures, and certificates are typically available through the state or county health department.
    Footprints: Taking a baby's footprints is common in many hospitals for identification and keepsake purposes. These prints are often given to parents but are not part of the official birth certificate or required by law. Practices vary by hospital, and some may not take footprints unless requested.

For specific details, check with the vital records office in the state where the birth occurred.

Efficiency: Enables dApps to interact across blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum) in real time, streamlining user experiences.
Cost Reduction: Lowers transaction costs by eliminating redundant bridge fees and optimizing gas usage.
Pain Reduction: Simplifies development for dApp creators by providing a unified interface, reducing complexity and integration time.

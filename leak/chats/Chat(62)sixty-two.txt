How much venture capital has been invested in to blockchain companies in the last 10 years? How much venture capital have gone into to AI companies in last 10 years? What have been the top 10 blockchain companies and the top 10 AO companies that raised the most venture capital money in the last 10 years?
Venture Capital Investment in Blockchain Companies (2015–2025)

Estimating the total venture capital (VC) invested in blockchain companies over the last 10 years is challenging due to the variability in data sources, the evolving nature of the crypto market, and the lack of comprehensive public datasets covering the entire period. However, based on available information, including reports from Galaxy, PitchBook, and other sources, we can piece together a reasonable estimate.

    Annual Data and Trends:
        2015–2017: Early blockchain VC activity was modest, with investments likely totaling $1–2 billion annually, driven by the initial coin offering (ICO) boom and early bets on Bitcoin and Ethereum infrastructure. Pantera Capital and Digital Currency Group were among the pioneers.cryptofundresearch.com
        2018–2019: Investments grew as blockchain applications expanded beyond cryptocurrencies. Crypto Fund Research estimates that Digital Currency Group alone made significant investments, with total VC likely in the $3–5 billion range annually.cryptofundresearch.com
        2020: A quieter year due to market consolidation, with approximately $3 billion invested.galaxy.com
        2021: A peak year for crypto VC, with $25–30 billion invested, fueled by DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 hype. Galaxy reports a high correlation between Bitcoin prices and VC activity during this period.galaxy.com
        2022: Despite a crypto market downturn, investments remained strong at $15–20 billion, though down from 2021’s peak.galaxy.com
        2023: VC activity dropped significantly to $10.7 billion, a 68% decline from 2022, due to regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.coinlaunch.space
        2024: Investments rebounded to $11.5 billion across 2,153 deals, with Q4 alone seeing $3.5 billion.galaxy.com
        2025 (Q1): A strong quarter with $4.8 billion invested, though $2 billion came from a single deal (Binance with MGX). Without this, the total was $2.8 billion.galaxy.com
    Total Estimate:
    Aggregating these figures, the total VC investment in blockchain companies from 2015 to Q1 2025 likely ranges between $80–100 billion. This accounts for fluctuations in deal sizes, unreported deals, and the inclusion of both equity and token investments. The estimate is conservative, as some sources suggest higher figures during the 2021–2022 bull market, but data gaps for earlier years limit precision.

Venture Capital Investment in AI Companies (2015–2025)

AI has seen explosive VC interest, particularly since the mainstream adoption of machine learning and generative AI tools post-2020. Data from Crunchbase, PitchBook, and other sources provide a clearer picture than for blockchain.

    Annual Data and Trends:
        2015–2017: AI investments grew steadily, with annual funding of $5–10 billion. Early focus was on enterprise AI, autonomous systems, and healthcare applications.vc-mapping.gilion.com
        2018–2019: Funding accelerated to $15–20 billion annually, driven by advancements in deep learning and broader industry adoption.vc-mapping.gilion.com
        2020: Approximately $25 billion, as AI infrastructure and vertical applications gained traction.vc-mapping.gilion.com
        2021: A breakout year with $50–60 billion invested, fueled by AI’s transformative potential in industries like healthtech and fintech.vc-mapping.gilion.com
        2022: Investments remained high at $50 billion, despite a broader VC slowdown.vc-mapping.gilion.com
        2023: Funding reached $55.6 billion, nearly doubling from 2022, with a focus on foundation models and infrastructure.vc-mapping.gilion.com
        2024: A record-breaking year with over $100 billion invested globally, accounting for 37% of total VC funding. The U.S. alone saw AI startups capture 46% of deal value.vc-mapping.gilion.com
        2025 (Q1): AI continued to dominate, with $59.6 billion invested globally, representing 53% of total VC funding.cvvc.com
    Total Estimate:
    Summing these figures, the total VC investment in AI companies from 2015 to Q1 2025 is approximately $350–400 billion. This reflects AI’s broader market appeal, capital-intensive nature (e.g., training large language models), and consistent investor enthusiasm compared to blockchain’s volatility.

Notes and Caveats

    Data Gaps: Blockchain funding data is less centralized than AI due to the prevalence of token sales and private deals, leading to potential underreporting. AI funding is better documented but still subject to undisclosed rounds.
    Overlap: Some companies, like those in decentralized AI (e.g., Grass, backed by Hack VC), blur the lines between blockchain and AI, but these are categorized based on their primary focus.coindesk.com
    Sources: The estimates and company lists draw from Galaxy, PitchBook, Crunchbase, Forbes, and other web sources, cross-referenced for accuracy.cvvc.comforbes.comvc-mapping.gilion.com
    Critical Perspective: Blockchain VC has been volatile, with peaks tied to crypto market cycles, while AI has seen more consistent growth due to broader enterprise adoption. Both sectors face risks—blockchain from regulatory uncertainty, AI from high capital costs and ethical concerns.

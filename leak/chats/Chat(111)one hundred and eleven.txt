History of Mandir Dargah Baba Peer Ratan Nath Ji Har Shri Nath Ji (Jhandewalan, New Delhi)

Based on the query, it appears you are referring to the Mandir Dargah Baba Peer Ratan Nath Ji Har Shri Nath Ji, a unique syncretic religious site in the Jhandewalan area of Karol Bagh, New Delhi. This shrine blends Hindu and Sufi traditions, honoring a revered Sufi saint (Peer Ratan Nath Ji) while incorporating elements of Hindu worship (referred to as "Har Shri Nath Ji"). It is locally known as a "mandir-dargah" (temple-shrine) and reflects the communal harmony of Delhi's diverse spiritual landscape. Below is a detailed history and overview, drawn from available records and devotee accounts.
Origins and Founding

    Early History and Spiritual Roots: The shrine is dedicated to Baba Peer Ratan Nath Ji, a Sufi saint from the Nath tradition (a syncretic yogic-Sufi lineage blending Hindu Nath Sampradaya with Islamic mysticism). The Nath tradition traces its origins to the 9th-10th centuries CE, influenced by figures like Gorakhnath, but Peer Ratan Nath Ji is believed to have lived in the 18th-19th century during the Mughal or early British era. Local lore describes him as a wandering ascetic (fakir) who attained enlightenment in the rocky Aravalli hills near present-day Jhandewalan, performing miracles and preaching unity between Hindus and Muslims.
    Establishment in Jhandewalan: In the late 18th century, the area was part of the lush, forested Delhi Ridge (Aravalli range), far from the urban bustle of today. Peer Ratan Nath Ji is said to have settled here, drawing devotees from both faiths. After his passing (samadhi or dargah establishment), his followers built a simple mausoleum (dargah) around 1800-1850 CE. The "Har Shri Nath Ji" aspect likely emerged from the saint's Nath yogic roots, where "Nath" refers to a Shaivite ascetic order, and "Har Shri Nath" invokes Lord Shiva (Har) as the supreme guru. Devotees chant "Har Shri Nath" as a mantra for protection and blessings, similar to Nath panth practices.
    Syncretic Nature: This site exemplifies Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb (Hindu-Muslim cultural synthesis) in Delhi. Hindus visit it as a "mandir" for Nath traditions, offering flowers and lighting lamps, while Muslims treat it as a dargah for urs (death anniversary) celebrations and qawwali. The structure includes a central tomb (mazar) for the peer, surrounded by shrines with idols or symbols of Shiva and Nath gurus.

Key Historical Events

    19th Century Growth: During the British Raj (post-1857 Revolt), the shrine gained prominence amid communal tensions. It became a refuge for locals, with stories of Peer Ratan Nath Ji's spirit protecting the area from famines and invasions. By the 1870s, the dargah was expanded with donations from merchants in Karol Bagh, a growing trading hub.
    20th Century Developments:
        In the 1920s-1930s, during the Indian independence movement, the site hosted interfaith gatherings, promoting unity.
        Post-Partition (1947), it served as a healing space for displaced families. Renovations in the 1960s added a small temple annex for Hindu rituals.
        In 1980s-1990s, urban expansion (including the Delhi Metro) encroached on the area, but the shrine was preserved due to community advocacy. The Jhandewalan Metro Station (opened 2005) now stands nearby, making it accessible.
    Modern Era: Managed by a local trust of devotees, the site underwent repairs in the 2010s for structural safety. It remains active, with annual urs in March-April (Ramzan-aligned) and Nath yogic festivals like Shivratri. As of 2025, it continues to attract 500-1,000 visitors daily, especially on Thursdays (peer day).

Significance and Beliefs

    Spiritual Importance: Devotees believe Peer Ratan Nath Ji grants wishes for health, prosperity, and family harmony. The mantra "Har Shri Nath Ji" is chanted for warding off evil (nazar utarna). It's particularly revered by truck drivers, laborers, and traders in Karol Bagh for protection during travels—echoing the "jhanda" (flag) tradition of nearby Jhandewalan Mata Mandir.
    Miracles and Lore: Folk tales recount the peer's ability to calm storms and heal the sick. One popular story: During a 19th-century cholera outbreak, his samadhi site miraculously provided clean water, saving the locality.
    Connection to Jhandewalan: The area derives its name from "jhanda" (flags) hoisted at the nearby Hindu Jhandewalan Mata Mandir (est. 18th century). This dargah shares the spiritual vibe, with flags flown here too, symbolizing devotion. It's often visited alongside the Mata temple and Hanuman Mandir for a full "Jhandewalan circuit."

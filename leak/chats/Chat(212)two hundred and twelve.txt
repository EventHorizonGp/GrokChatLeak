Executive Summary: Iskra
Company Status

Iskra is a private, for-profit company.
Founding and Headquarters

Iskra was founded in 2022 and is headquartered in Singapore.
Founders

The company was founded by Hong Kyu Lee, a South Korean entrepreneur with a background in technology and gaming. He holds degrees in computer science and has extensive professional experience in IT startups and blockchain ventures in Asia. His most significant achievements include leading previous tech firms to successful funding rounds and pioneering early Web3 projects that integrated gaming with decentralized technologies, which directly informed Iskra's focus on blockchain gaming ecosystems.

The leadership team includes veterans from blockchain and video game industries, though specific co-founders beyond Hong Kyu Lee are not publicly detailed in available sources.
CEO and CTO

    CEO: Eugene Lee, with a strong background in gaming and blockchain, previously involved in IT and gaming veteran roles.
    CTO: Not publicly specified in available data; the technical leadership is handled by a team of experts in blockchain development.

Product and Services

Iskra offers an all-in-one Web3 gaming platform that integrates blockchain services, including a wallet, decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT marketplace, governance staking, and a suite of Web3 games. The unique innovation is the ActFi (Activity-Focused Incentive) system, which rewards users for contributions to the ecosystem, such as community participation, gameplay, and content creation, using the native $ISK token. This creates a sustainable, community-driven economy beyond traditional play-to-earn models.

The platform helps customers—gamers and game studios—operate more efficiently by providing seamless access to blockchain tools without needing multiple apps, reducing transaction costs through integrated DEX and wallet services, and alleviating pain points like fragmented rewards and lack of ownership by enabling true digital asset ownership and ongoing earnings (even offline in some games). Studios benefit from easier game launches and monetization via Iskra's publishing support.
Market

Target customers include individual gamers seeking rewarding blockchain experiences and game studios looking to launch Web3 titles. The total addressable market (TAM) for blockchain gaming is estimated at USD 12.21 billion in 2024, projected to grow to USD 17.50 billion in 2025, with further expansion driven by increasing adoption of Web3 technologies.
Competition

Primary competitors include Oasys (blockchain game development platform), Proof of Play (NFT-based gaming), Trailblazer Games (strategy NFT platforms), Metalcore (Web3 gaming), and other hubs like Axie Infinity or Decentraland.

Iskra's top six competitive advantages:

    All-in-One Ecosystem: Combines gaming, wallet, DEX, and governance in a single platform, reducing user friction.
    ActFi Reward System: Unique activity-based incentives for sustainable user engagement and ecosystem growth.
    Strong Backing and Partnerships: Supported by major investors like Animoca Brands and Kakao Ventures, enabling robust integrations and credibility.
    Community-Centric Model: Rewards contributions beyond gameplay, fostering loyalty and organic growth.
    Offline Earnings and Accessibility: Features like offline rewards in games make it more user-friendly than competitors.
    Audited Security and Scalability: Certified by firms like Certik, ensuring trust in a volatile sector.

In terms of market share in the core Web3 gaming hub market, Iskra ranks in the top tier among dApps, with notable traction (e.g., top-ranking games and partnerships), but specific percentage share is not publicly quantified; it generated $8 million in revenue in 2022, indicating a growing but mid-tier position compared to leaders like Axie Infinity.
Business Model and Sales Status

Iskra's business model involves publishing Web3 games, earning through transaction fees on its DEX and NFT marketplace, token staking governance, and rewards distribution via the $ISK token (with 20 million $ISK allocated annually for ActFi). It monetizes by bridging gamers and studios, taking a cut from in-game economies and partnerships.

The company is ramping revenue, having moved beyond pre-revenue stages. Its annual revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $8 million based on 2022 figures (latest available). Revenue projections for the next three years are not publicly disclosed, but given market growth and recent partnerships, conservative estimates suggest scaling to $15-25 million by 2026, assuming continued adoption.
Venture Capital Backers

Top venture capital investors include Kakao Ventures, KB Investment, Animoca Brands, GSR, LINE Ventures, Netmarble, Wemade, and Planetarium.

The company has raised a total of $74.5 million in venture capital across five rounds. The last round was a Series A on an unspecified date in 2022 (first round April 6, 2022). The last known valuation is not publicly available but is below unicorn status based on funding amounts. Iskra is not a unicorn (valuation under $1 billion). The company's exit goal appears to lean toward going public via an IPO, given its focus on scaling in the growing Web3 sector, though mergers with larger gaming or blockchain firms remain possible.
Company Momentum

Based on ongoing fundraising success (consistent rounds totaling $74.5 million), rising valuation implied by investor interest, revenue growth from $0 to $8 million in early years, and increasing social media/media buzz (e.g., recent X posts on partnerships and listings generating engagement), Iskra's overall momentum is strong and accelerating. It is on a positive trajectory toward a successful IPO, with expansions into new games and chains like Base signaling readiness for public markets.

Yes, the company should be named to the Cryptonite Top 300 private companies, as it operates in the blockchain and crypto sectors, specifically Web3 gaming.

Recent top three big news stories:

    Partnership with Elderglade to integrate AI-driven retro gaming on LINE Mini Dapp, achieving over 9 million monthly active users (March 2025).
    Launch of two new Web3 games with Grampus CWC following the success of Norma in Metaland (November 2023, but ongoing buzz into 2025).
    Listing of $ISK token on AscendEX exchange, enabling trading and boosting liquidity (August 2025).

Let n and k be positive integers. The square in the ith
row and jth column of an n-by-n grid contains the num-
ber i + j−k. For which n and k is it possible to select
n squares from the grid, no two in the same row or col-
umn, such that the numbers contained in the selected
squares are exactly 1, 2, . . . , n?

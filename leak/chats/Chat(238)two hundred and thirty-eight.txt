Sandton Debt Counselling

Sandton Debt Counselling is a trusted service dedicated to helping over-indebted consumers in South Africa regain control of their finances through expert debt management and debt review processes. With a team of highly qualified professionals, they provide personalized solutions to restructure debt, lower interest rates, and create affordable repayment plans, ensuring financial freedom for their clients.
What is Debt Counselling?

Debt counselling, also referred to as debt review, is a legal process designed to assist individuals struggling to meet their monthly debt obligations. At Sandton Debt Counselling, a National Credit Regulator (NCR)-registered debt counsellor assesses your income, expenses, and debts. They negotiate with creditors to reduce monthly payments and interest rates, consolidating your debts into a single, affordable monthly instalment. This process protects your assets from repossession and prevents legal action from creditors, giving you peace of mind while you work toward becoming debt-free.

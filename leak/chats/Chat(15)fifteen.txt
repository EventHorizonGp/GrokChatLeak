Is the economy output of Africa yearly over $3trillion?

No, Africa's annual economic output (nominal GDP in current US dollars) is not over $3 trillion as of the latest available data and projections.

    Recent estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and related analyses place Africa's total GDP at approximately $2.8 trillion for both 2024 and projected for 2025.
    Earlier data points include around $3.1 trillion cited for 2023 in some older Statista/IMF summaries, but more current IMF-based reports consistently show figures below $3 trillion for recent and near-term years.
    For context, the continent's largest economies (e.g., South Africa ~$373–400 billion, Egypt ~$348 billion, Algeria ~$267 billion in 2024) contribute significantly, but the aggregate remains under $3 trillion due to factors like currency fluctuations, commodity prices, and varying growth rates across 54 countries.

These figures refer to nominal GDP, the standard measure of yearly economic output. Projections suggest gradual growth, but not exceeding $3 trillion imminently based on current trends.

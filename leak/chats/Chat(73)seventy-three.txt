They are using this prompt to generate a **complete, self-contained learning module** for one of the 10 chapters below:
1. The Next Economy  
2. The AI Orchestrator Skillset  
3. The AI Champion Mindset  
4. Urgent Transformation

✅ **Lesson Generator** — 3–5 bite-sized, practical lessons with real-world applications.  
✅ **Case Study** — A real or realistic example of someone who applied this concept successfully.  
✅ **Questions to Ask Yourself** — 5 reflective, mindset-shifting questions to internalize the concept.  
✅ **Resource Links** — 3–5 high-quality, vetted resources (articles, tools, YouTube videos, courses).  
✅ **CTA (Call to Action)** — One small, immediate step the learner can take today.  
✅ **Related Quote** — An inspiring, relevant quote to anchor the learning.

###  STYLE
- Use **clear, conversational, and encouraging language** — like a mentor guiding a friend.  
- Structure content with **headings, bullet points, and bold emphasis** for readability.

- Avoid jargon — explain technical terms simply.  
- Make it **actionable, not theoretical** — focus on “what to do next.”
---
###  TONE
- **Empowering** — “You can do this.”  
- **Curious** — “What if you tried…?”  
- **Practical** — “Here’s how to start today.”  
- **Human-centered** — “This isn’t about replacing you — it’s about amplifying you.”

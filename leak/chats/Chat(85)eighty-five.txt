Is this video statement on X by Elon Musk real or AI? https://x.com/gewoonmerels/status/1895792011627938163?s=46
Key Points

    It seems likely that the video statement on X by Elon Musk is AI-generated, based on community notes and user replies.
    The community note on the X post explicitly states it is AI-generated, with multiple users agreeing in the replies.
    There is no evidence from official sources or fact-checking websites that the video is real, increasing the likelihood it is fabricated.

Analysis
Overview

The video in question, posted by the user "gewoonmerels" on X, claims to show Elon Musk discussing the "real danger behind Zelensky" and criticizing political support for him. Given the current date, March 2, 2025, and the context of ongoing discussions about Ukraine, this video has raised questions about its authenticity.
Evidence of AI Generation

The X post includes a community note stating, "This is an AI generated audio and video," and links to a resource on spotting AI-generated content . Additionally, several replies to the post, such as those from users like Richard Wragsdale and Christian Overduin, explicitly label it as "AI" or "fake," reinforcing the community note's claim. This consensus among users and the platform's fact-checking feature suggests the video is not a genuine recording of Elon Musk.
Lack of Official Confirmation

Searches for the video on platforms like YouTube and news outlets, using queries like "Elon Musk video about danger behind Zelensky," did not yield any results confirming its authenticity. Elon Musk's official X account  has not shared this video, and there are no reports from reputable sources, such as POLITICO or The Guardian, indicating he made such a statement. This absence of official backing further supports the likelihood of it being AI-generated.
Unexpected Detail: Community-Driven Fact-Checking

An interesting aspect is the role of X's community notes feature, rolled out in 2022, which allows users to collaboratively fact-check content. This feature, as seen in the post @gewoonmerels, has been pivotal in identifying AI-generated content, highlighting a shift toward user-driven verification on social media platforms.
Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of the Video Statement's Authenticity

This section provides a comprehensive examination of the video statement on X by Elon Musk, posted by the user "gewoonmerels" on March 1, 2025, at 11:03 UTC, with the text "Elon Musk verteld het echte gevaar achter Zelensky, en de politiek blijft maar steunen." Translated, this means "Elon Musk tells the real danger behind Zelensky, and politics still continues to support." The analysis aims to determine whether this video is a genuine recording or AI-generated, considering the current geopolitical context and Musk's public statements about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Initial Observations and Community Feedback

The X post includes a community note stating, "This is an AI generated audio and video," and references a resource on AI content detection . This note is significant, as X's community notes feature, introduced in 2022, relies on user contributions to fact-check content, providing a layer of crowd-sourced verification. Additionally, the thread contains multiple replies reinforcing this claim:

    Richard Wragsdale (@RWragsdale41788) commented, "Ai," at 19:11 UTC on March 1, 2025.
    Christian Overduin (@Chris82Overduin) stated, "100% AI generated🤡," at 19:12 UTC on March 1, 2025.
    Don Cline (@dcline0721) remarked, "Fake ass video," at 19:12 UTC on March 1, 2025.
    Other users, such as Kevin (@Kevin1122367) and Luis Amaya (@ichooseluis), also labeled it as "AI propaganda" and "AI," respectively, indicating a strong consensus among respondents.

This collective user feedback, combined with the community note, suggests a high likelihood that the video is not authentic. The note also links to a Rev blog category on AI and speech recognition, which, while not directly accessible in full, implies a resource for identifying AI-generated audio and video, further supporting the claim.
Investigation of the Video Source

The X post includes a shortened URL, "https://t.co/3XcRkRVwa7," which appears to host the video on X itself, as attempts to expand the link did not reveal external hosting platforms like YouTube. Efforts to search for the video using queries such as "Elon Musk video about danger behind Zelensky" on search engines and site-specific YouTube searches youtube.com did not yield the specific video, nor did they find any official uploads by Musk or his verified accounts. This lack of presence on official channels is notable, given Musk's active engagement on X, where he has over 216 million followers and frequently shares content.
Contextual Analysis: Musk's Public Statements

Elon Musk has a history of commenting on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, often critically, especially in the context of U.S. aid and the Russia-Ukraine war. For instance:

    On February 18, 2025, Musk expressed support for a post accusing Zelensky of prioritizing "money and power" over peace, replying with a "100" emoji, as reported by POLITICO.
    In October 2023, he mocked Zelensky's calls for aid with a meme, drawing backlash from Ukrainian officials, as noted by The Independent.
    More recently, on February 20, 2025, Musk claimed Zelensky's approval is low, alleging he canceled elections, as covered by Al Jazeera.

However, these statements are text-based or involve memes, not video statements like the one in question. Searches for video content specifically addressing the "danger behind Zelensky" did not uncover any official recordings, and fact-checking efforts, such as those by AFP Fact Check, focused on other Musk-related claims without mentioning this video.
Comparative Analysis with AI Detection

Given the community note's assertion, it is useful to consider how AI-generated videos are typically identified. Resources like Capitol Technology University suggest looking for inconsistencies in details, such as unnatural movements or lighting, and conducting reverse image searches. While the video itself could not be analyzed directly, the consensus on X, combined with the absence of official corroboration, aligns with common indicators of AI generation, such as lack of source verification and user flagging.
Table: Summary of Evidence
Evidence Type	Details	Implication
Community Note	States "AI generated audio and video," links to AI detection resource.	Strong indication of fabrication.
User Replies	Multiple users label it "AI," "fake," reinforcing community note.	Supports AI generation likelihood.
Official Source Search	No evidence on Musk's X account  or news outlets.	Suggests video is not authentic.
Fact-Checking Efforts	No reports confirming video; other Musk-Zelensky claims fact-checked instead.	Increases likelihood of AI origin.
Conclusion

Based on the community note, user consensus, and lack of official or fact-checked evidence supporting the video's authenticity, it seems highly likely that the video statement on X by Elon Musk is AI-generated. This conclusion is further supported by the absence of the video on Musk's official channels and the context of his previous statements, which do not include such a video. The role of X's community notes feature, as seen here, highlights an unexpected but growing reliance on user-driven fact-checking, especially in identifying AI-generated content in real-time.

Which reporters or journalists are honest and effiicient in India and Odisha?

Determining the honesty and efficiency of journalists is subjective and depends on various factors such as their track record, reporting style, and public perception. However, I can highlight some notable journalists from India and specifically Odisha who are widely recognized for their work and credibility based on available information and sentiment expressed in public forums.
India

Here are a few journalists from India who have earned reputations for their impactful and principled reporting:

    Ravish Kumar: Formerly with NDTV, Ravish Kumar is celebrated for his ground-level reporting and focus on social justice issues affecting ordinary citizens. His integrity earned him the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2019, and he now runs an independent YouTube channel where he continues to cover underreported stories.
    Shekhar Gupta: With over 40 years in journalism, Gupta is known for his political reporting and policy analysis. As the founder of The Print, he has maintained a focus on investigative journalism, notably during his tenure at the Indian Express, where he oversaw coverage of major scandals like the Bofors case.
    Barkha Dutt: A veteran journalist with NDTV and later Tiranga TV, Dutt is recognized for her fearless war reporting, particularly during the Kargil conflict, for which she received the Padma Shri. Despite controversies, her work is noted for its boldness and depth.

These journalists have been praised for their commitment to truth and their ability to navigate India’s complex media landscape, though opinions on their work can vary depending on individual perspectives.
Odisha

In Odisha, a few journalists stand out for their contributions to regional journalism, particularly through leading Odia-language publications:

    Soumya Ranjan Patnaik: As the editor of Sambad, one of Odisha’s most widely circulated newspapers, Patnaik is a prominent figure in Odia journalism. His work has been recognized with awards like the Harekrushna Mahatab Samman, reflecting his influence and credibility in the state.
    Bamapada Tripathy: Associated with The Samaja, Tripathy has built a reputation as a respected editor. His leadership at one of Odisha’s oldest newspapers underscores his efficiency and commitment to delivering reliable news.
    Gopal Krushna Mohapatra: As a key figure at The Prameya, Mohapatra is noted for his editorial work in another major Odia daily. His contributions have helped maintain the paper’s standing in the region.

These Odisha-based journalists are often cited for their roles in shaping public discourse through trusted regional media outlets. Their credibility stems from years of consistent reporting and their influence within the state’s media ecosystem, as reflected in posts on X and other sources.
Notes

Perceptions of "honesty" and "efficiency" can differ based on personal or political biases, and no journalist is immune to criticism. For a more tailored assessment, I could analyze specific X posts or profiles of these individuals if you’d like—just let me know! Additionally, my knowledge is fresh up to March 19, 2025, and I’ve drawn from a mix of public recognition and available data to compile this list.

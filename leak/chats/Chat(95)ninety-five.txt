OpenAI Forecast Shows Shift From Microsoft to SoftBank
Key Points

    It seems likely that the article from The Information, titled "OpenAI Forecast Shows Shift From Microsoft to SoftBank," discusses OpenAI's plan to transition its computing power needs from Microsoft to SoftBank by 2030, primarily through the Stargate project.
    Research suggests that by 2030, OpenAI expects 75% of its data center capacity to come from Stargate, backed heavily by SoftBank, marking a significant shift from Microsoft, its current main provider.
    The evidence leans toward OpenAI increasing spending on Microsoft's data centers in the short term, with projected cash burn rising to $20 billion in 2027 from $5 billion in 2024.
    An unexpected detail is the involvement of a $500 billion joint venture, Stargate, including partners like Oracle and Abu Dhabi's MGX, with SoftBank contributing at least $30 billion of a $40 billion raise for OpenAI.

Overview

The article from The Information highlights a strategic shift in OpenAI's infrastructure, moving away from reliance on Microsoft toward a partnership with SoftBank, facilitated by the Stargate project. This change is set to unfold over the next five years, with significant financial implications and new collaborations.
Details on the Shift

OpenAI's plan involves transitioning its computing power needs, with a target of sourcing three-quarters of its data center capacity from Stargate by 2030. This project, heavily financed by SoftBank, represents a move away from Microsoft, which currently fulfills most of OpenAI's power needs as its biggest shareholder. However, the shift won't happen immediately, with OpenAI planning to increase spending on Microsoft's data centers in the interim.
Financial Implications

The article notes a dramatic increase in OpenAI's operational costs, projecting a cash burn of $20 billion in 2027, up significantly from $5 billion in 2024. Additionally, SoftBank is expected to provide at least $30 billion of the $40 billion OpenAI aims to raise, supporting its $260 billion valuation, with half of this funding allocated to Stargate.
Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of OpenAI's Strategic Shift as Reported by The Information

This note provides a comprehensive examination of the article from The Information, titled "OpenAI Forecast Shows Shift From Microsoft to SoftBank," published on February 21, 2025. The analysis is based on reports from various sources that reference the original article, given its paywalled nature. The findings detail OpenAI's strategic pivot in computing infrastructure, financial projections, and the broader implications of this shift.
Background and Context

The Information, a subscription-based news outlet focusing on technology and business, reported on OpenAI's future plans regarding its computing power providers. This report, dated February 21, 2025, coincides with recent developments in OpenAI's partnerships and investments, particularly its relationship with Microsoft and emerging ties with SoftBank. The article's timing aligns with discussions around AI infrastructure and the competitive landscape of cloud computing services.
Key Findings on the Shift

The core of the article centers on OpenAI's forecast to shift its computing needs from Microsoft to SoftBank by 2030, primarily through the Stargate project. According to reports from TechCrunch and Data Center Dynamics (DCD), OpenAI expects to source 75% of its data center capacity from Stargate by the end of the decade. This represents a significant departure from Microsoft, which currently provides most of OpenAI's compute power as its largest shareholder.

The transition is not immediate; OpenAI plans to increase its spending on Microsoft-owned data centers in the next few years, indicating a gradual shift. This interim strategy is detailed in the TechCrunch report, which notes that the change "won't happen overnight."
Financial Projections and Investments

A critical aspect of the article is the financial forecast, highlighting OpenAI's escalating operational costs. The Information reports, as cited by TechCrunch, that OpenAI projects to burn $20 billion in cash during 2027, a sharp rise from the $5 billion it reportedly burned through in 2024. This increase underscores the growing demands of AI model development and deployment.

Further, the DCD report adds that SoftBank will provide at least $30 billion of the $40 billion OpenAI is hoping to raise to secure its $260 billion valuation. Approximately half of this funding is earmarked for Stargate, a $500 billion joint venture involving OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi's MGX. This venture aims to deploy large data centers across the US, with OpenAI expecting to have $10 billion of the total funds raised by the end of March 2025.
Details of the Stargate Project

The Stargate project emerges as a pivotal element in this shift, described as a collaborative effort led by President Donald Trump, with plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI data centers, particularly in Texas, as noted by VoIP Review. Partners include not only OpenAI and SoftBank but also Oracle and Abu Dhabi's MGX, with Microsoft now confirmed only as a "key initial technology partner." This diversification of partnerships is unexpected, given Microsoft's historical dominance in OpenAI's infrastructure.
Comparative Analysis with Existing Partnerships

Microsoft's role, while diminishing in the long term, remains significant in the short term. Reports indicate that Microsoft holds the "right of first refusal" for additional capacity, as mentioned in a CNBC article from January 2025, reflecting a complex relationship. This adjustment follows Microsoft's $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has faced antitrust scrutiny, as noted by The Register.

In contrast, SoftBank's involvement is framed as a new financial backbone, with a $40 billion investment announced earlier in February 2025, part of which supports Stargate. This investment, detailed in The Register, dwarfs Microsoft's contributions and signals a shift in the AI investment landscape.
Implications and Future Outlook

The shift has several implications, including potential changes in the competitive dynamics of cloud computing and AI infrastructure. OpenAI's move to reduce reliance on Microsoft could mitigate antitrust concerns but introduces new dependencies on SoftBank and the Stargate consortium. The financial projections, with a projected cash burn of $320 billion between now and 2030 (as per Spyglass), suggest a massive scale-up, with more than half allocated to model training, potentially outpacing inference costs by 2030.

This strategic pivot also aligns with broader trends in AI, where companies seek diversified partnerships to manage escalating compute demands. The involvement of international players like Abu Dhabi's MGX and the focus on US-based data centers reflect geopolitical and economic considerations.

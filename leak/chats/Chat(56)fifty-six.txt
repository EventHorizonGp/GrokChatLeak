Relatively concisely describe the Jobs To Be Done Framework. No backstory on it, just explain how, why, and in what situations it works well.

The Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Framework focuses on understanding customer behavior by identifying the "job" a customer is trying to accomplish, rather than demographics or product features.
How It Works

    Define the Job: Frame the customer's goal as a verb-based statement (e.g., "restore confidence in my smile" instead of "buy whitening toothpaste").
    Map the Job Steps: Break the job into 6–8 sequential steps (e.g., recognize need → research options → purchase → apply → evaluate results).
    Identify Struggles & Priorities: At each step, uncover pain points, emotional drivers, and success metrics via customer interviews (not surveys).
    Innovate Against the Job: Design solutions that help customers progress faster, with less anxiety, or at lower cost—often revealing underserved jobs or new markets.

Why It Works

    Progress-Centric: Customers "hire" products to make progress in specific circumstances, not because of who they are.
    Predictive: Jobs are stable over time (unlike trends), enabling long-term strategy.
    Unbiased: Forces evidence from customers’ actual struggles, reducing assumption-driven failures.

Situations Where It Excels

    Mature Markets: Differentiate commoditized products (e.g., milkshakes as morning commute companions).
    Disruptive Innovation: Spot jobs incumbents ignore (e.g., Intuit’s QuickBooks for "avoid IRS penalties" vs. accounting software).
    B2B Complexity: Align cross-functional teams around customer outcomes (e.g., "reduce downtime in manufacturing lines").
    Early-Stage Validation: Test demand before building by interviewing for job intensity and unmet needs.

has two state solution been proposed in Israel and Gaza?

Yes, the two-state solution has been proposed as a framework to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the situation involving Israel and Gaza. It envisions two independent states—Israel for the Jewish people and Palestine for the Palestinian people, with the Palestinian state typically including the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and parts of East Jerusalem, based on pre-1967 borders. Below is a concise overview of its history and status:
Historical Proposals and Developments

    Origins (1937–1947): The concept emerged with the 1937 Peel Commission, which proposed partitioning British Mandate Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. The 1947 UN Partition Plan (Resolution 181) further outlined two states, but it was accepted by Jewish leaders and rejected by Arab leaders, leading to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.en.wikipedia.orgun.org
    Oslo Accords (1993–1995): The most significant progress toward a two-state solution occurred with the Oslo Accords, where Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) agreed to mutual recognition and steps toward Palestinian self-governance. The accords established the Palestinian Authority (PA) to administer parts of the West Bank and Gaza, aiming for a negotiated two-state outcome. However, final status issues (borders, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements) remained unresolved.britannica.comtheconversation.comcfr.org
    Camp David Summit (2000) and Taba Talks (2001): These negotiations, led by U.S. President Bill Clinton, aimed to finalize a two-state agreement but failed, primarily over disagreements on Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees.en.wikipedia.orgreuters.com
    Road Map for Peace (2003): Proposed by the U.S., EU, Russia, and UN, this plan outlined steps toward a two-state solution but stalled due to ongoing violence and disagreements.cfr.orgun.org
    Annapolis Conference (2007): Israel, the PLO, and the U.S. reaffirmed commitment to a two-state solution, but talks collapsed over issues like settlements and security.en.wikipedia.orgcfr.org
    2013–2014 Peace Talks: U.S.-mediated talks under Secretary of State John Kerry failed due to disputes over Israeli settlements and Palestinian unity efforts.en.wikipedia.orgreuters.com

Recent Developments (Post-October 2023)

    Hamas Attack and Gaza War: The October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people, and Israel’s subsequent military campaign in Gaza, which killed over 27,000 Palestinians, have complicated the two-state solution. The conflict has deepened distrust, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly rejecting Palestinian statehood, citing security concerns.en.wikipedia.orgtheguardian.comtheguardian.com
    International Push: Despite setbacks, global leaders have revived calls for a two-state solution:
        In January 2025, a U.S.-Egypt-Qatar-mediated ceasefire briefly paused the Gaza conflict, but Israel’s renewed offensive in March 2025 and aid blockades worsened the humanitarian crisis, prompting renewed international focus on a political solution.cfr.orgnews.un.org
        On September 26, 2024, Saudi Arabia and Norway co-chaired a UN General Assembly meeting with 90 countries to launch a global alliance for a two-state solution.en.wikipedia.org
        UN Secretary-General António Guterres has consistently emphasized the two-state solution as the only viable path, warning in April 2025 that it is “nearing collapse” due to Israeli settlements and Palestinian displacement.@UNpress.un.orgnews.un.org
        Countries like France, Australia, and Indonesia have expressed support, with some (e.g., Spain, Ireland, Norway) recognizing Palestinian statehood to push for a two-state framework.theconversation.comdiplomatie.gouv.fraljazeera.com
    Palestinian and Israeli Perspectives:
        The PLO, governing parts of the West Bank, supports a two-state solution based on 1967 borders. Hamas, controlling Gaza, has historically rejected Israel’s existence but in 2017 indicated conditional acceptance of a Palestinian state within 1967 borders, though without recognizing Israel. Hardline leaders like Yahya Sinwar (killed in 2024) opposed this.en.wikipedia.orgbritannica.comnews.sky.com
        Israeli public support has waned, with a 2023 Pew survey showing only 35% of Israelis believing in peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state, down from 50% in 2013. Palestinian support is also low, with a 2023 Gallup poll indicating 24% in Gaza and the West Bank favoring the solution, down from 59% in 2012.theguardian.comchannel4.com
    Obstacles:
        Israeli Settlements: Over 700,000 settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, fragmenting Palestinian territory and complicating a contiguous state. Settlements are deemed illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.en.wikipedia.orgnpr.orgnews.sky.com
        Jerusalem: Both sides claim it as their capital, with disputes over holy sites like the Temple Mount and Al-Aqsa Mosque.reuters.comnews.sky.com
        Security: Israel demands control over Palestinian security to prevent attacks, while Palestinians seek full sovereignty.npr.orgtheguardian.com
        Palestinian Refugees: The right of return for millions of Palestinian refugees remains contentious, as Israel fears demographic shifts.theguardian.comnews.sky.com
        Political Divisions: Hamas’s control of Gaza and the PA’s limited authority in the West Bank hinder unified Palestinian representation.theconversation.comchannel4.com
        Israeli Leadership: Netanyahu’s coalition, including far-right parties, prioritizes settlement expansion and opposes Palestinian statehood.cfr.orgtheguardian.com

Alternative Proposals

    One-State Solution: Some advocate a single democratic state with equal rights for all, but this is rejected by Israel as it would end its Jewish majority and by many Palestinians due to fears of continued inequality.theguardian.comvox.com
    Confederation Model: A less common proposal suggests two sovereign states with shared institutions, open borders, and cooperation, addressing issues like movement and Jerusalem’s status.tcf.org

Current Status

The two-state solution remains the dominant international framework, endorsed by the U.S., UN, EU, and others, but its feasibility is questioned due to ongoing violence, settlement expansion, and lack of political will. The Gaza war has both revived diplomatic efforts and highlighted deep challenges, with Netanyahu’s stance and Palestinian divisions creating significant hurdles. Polls show declining support on both sides, and the UN warns that without “irreversible steps,” the solution may become unattainable.news.un.orgchannel4.com

What is the 'secret' eye treatment being advertised?  Can you get me the likely BS info behind their paywall?

The advertisement appears to be a teaser for a video sales pitch promoting a dietary supplement called RetinaClear (sometimes stylized as Retina Clear), which is positioned as a natural, non-prescription formula for supporting eye health. Based on the linked landing page and related content, the "secret" treatment isn't a single trick or hack but rather a supplement formula claimed to restore "perfect 20/20 vision in weeks at any age" through an "odd 'red root hack'"—likely a marketing term referring to the ingredient astaxanthin, a red-pigmented antioxidant derived from algae (often hyped in supplements for its anti-inflammatory properties).
Key Claims and Pitch Details

The video-linked page (which the ad funnels users to) frames this as a breakthrough discovered by a "cancelled optometrist," suggesting it's controversial because it threatens the eye care industry's profits from glasses, contacts, and surgeries. The narrative implies the formula works by enhancing stem cell activity in the eyes, improving neural progenitor cell proliferation, and boosting visual function to reverse age-related decline, poor vision, glaucoma, or macular degeneration. Specific promises include:

    Rapid restoration of flawless eyesight without prescriptions, exercises, or invasive procedures.
    Benefits for anyone, regardless of age or severity of vision issues.
    Backed by "hidden" research that Big Pharma supposedly suppresses.

However, no direct evidence or clinical trials specific to the product are provided; instead, it cites general studies on individual ingredients (more on that below). The page doesn't embed the full video but prompts users to "watch now," leading to what seems like a long-form video sales letter (VSL) typical of these ads—often 20-60 minutes of storytelling, testimonials, and urgency tactics before revealing the product and buy button.
The Product and Ingredients

RetinaClear is marketed as a capsule-based vision support supplement. While the exact full formula isn't detailed on the teaser pages, referenced components include:

    Astaxanthin: The probable "red root" element, claimed to improve visual acuity, reduce eye fatigue, and support stem cell regeneration in the retina.
    Zeaxanthin and Lutein: Carotenoids said to enhance macular pigment density, protect against blue light damage, and improve overall eye health.
    N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC): An antioxidant purported to boost mesenchymal stem cell function and combat oxidative stress in the eyes.
    Eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) extract: A herbal ingredient alleged to soothe corneal cells and reduce inflammation.

These are common in over-the-counter eye supplements (e.g., similar to the AREDS2 formula recommended by eye doctors for slowing macular degeneration progression). The pitch ties them to studies like:

    NCBI papers on astaxanthin's effects on visual function and stem cells.getretinaclear.com
    The NIH's Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS/AREDS2), which show benefits from antioxidants for certain eye conditions but emphasize they prevent worsening, not reverse damage to perfect vision.getretinaclear.com

Pricing and purchase details aren't shown upfront, but based on similar products and reviews, it likely involves a "special offer" after the video, such as:

    Bottles starting at $49-69 each, with bulk deals (e.g., 3-6 months' supply) and upsells for additional supplements or e-books.
    A "paywall" in the form of the VSL gating the order form—users must watch or skip through to access buying options, often with a 60-day money-back guarantee to build trust.
    No subscription trap mentioned, but auto-ships are common in these niches.

Testimonials and "Proof"

The pages don't include specific user stories or doctor endorsements in the visible content, but VSLs like this typically feature scripted testimonials (e.g., "I threw away my glasses after 2 weeks!") and before/after claims without verifiable sources. Some external reviews note positive experiences for mild eye support (e.g., reduced dryness), but nothing substantiating dramatic vision restoration.accessnewswire.com
Why It's Likely BS

While the ingredients have some evidence for maintaining eye health (e.g., lutein and zeaxanthin can help with age-related issues), the extravagant claims of fully restoring 20/20 vision in weeks—especially for irreversible conditions like glaucoma (which damages the optic nerve) or advanced macular degeneration—are unsubstantiated and not supported by mainstream ophthalmology. Real eye experts, like those from the National Eye Institute, recommend these nutrients as preventive aids, not cures. The "industry conspiracy" angle is a classic red flag for overhyped supplements, similar to other dubious products like SightCare that make parallel unproven promises. Scam checkers give the site mixed but mostly neutral ratings (e.g., 65-78% trust scores), indicating it's not outright fraudulent but potentially misleading in its marketing. If you're considering it, consult an actual eye doctor first—these ads prey on hope but rarely deliver miracles.

Executive Summary: Courtyard.io

Courtyard.io is a private, for-profit company founded in 2021 and headquartered in San Francisco, California.
Founders

The company was co-founded by Nicolas le Jeune and Paulin Andurand, both originally from France. Nicolas le Jeune, the CEO, previously worked at YouTube and Google, bringing expertise in product management and scaling digital platforms. His significant achievements include contributing to YouTube's growth and now leading Courtyard.io to raise over $37 million in funding while pioneering tokenized collectibles. Paulin Andurand, the CTO, spent eight years as a software engineer at Apple, focusing on building robust systems. His key accomplishments pertain to engineering scalable tech infrastructure, which has enabled Courtyard.io's seamless integration of blockchain with physical assets.
Product

Courtyard.io offers a platform that tokenizes physical collectibles—such as Pokémon cards, sports cards, and graded comics—into NFTs on the Polygon blockchain. The unique innovation lies in bridging physical and digital ownership: items are authenticated, securely vaulted and insured by Brink's, and represented as NFTs for instant trading, while users retain the option to redeem the physical item worldwide. This helps customers operate more efficiently by enabling anytime, anywhere access to buying, selling, or trading without physical handling; more cheaply by eliminating shipping and storage costs; and with less pain through reduced risks of damage, fraud, or logistics hassles.
Market

Target customers include collectors of trading cards, comics, and other memorabilia, spanning both traditional (web2) enthusiasts and web3 users seeking digital liquidity. The total addressable market for collectibles is vast, with the global trading card market alone valued at over $10 billion and growing rapidly, driven by hyper-growth in categories like Pokémon.

Competition

Primary competitors include Whatnot (livestream shopping for collectibles), Collectors (authentication and grading services), Americana (fractional ownership of assets), and Rarible (NFT marketplace). Courtyard.io's top six competitive advantages are: (1) blockchain-enabled transparency and ownership verification; (2) free, insured vaulting with Brink's for security; (3) instant digital trading without physical risks; (4) on-demand pack ripping and vending machines for engaging experiences; (5) seamless redemption of physical items worldwide; and (6) integration with Polygon for low-cost, efficient transactions. In terms of market share in its core tokenized collectibles niche, Courtyard.io ranks among the leaders as one of the fastest-growing startups, capturing significant volume on Polygon and surpassing $1 million in monthly sales.

Business and Revenue Model

The business model revolves around a marketplace and tokenization service where users buy, sell, and trade tokenized collectibles, with revenue generated through transaction fees, pack sales via digital vending machines, and potential premiums on redemptions. The company is ramping revenue, having achieved an annual revenue run rate of approximately $9 million as of mid-2025. Revenue projections for the next three years are not publicly disclosed, but given recent growth and funding, analysts anticipate continued scaling, potentially reaching $20-50 million ARR by 2028 based on market expansion.

Venture Capital Backers

Top venture capital investors include Forerunner Ventures, NEA, Y Combinator, Burst Capital, Prelude, ParaFi, OpenSea Ventures, Cherry Ventures, and notable angels like Gary Vaynerchuk. The company has raised a total of $37.5 million. The last round was a $30 million Series A on July 24, 2025. The last known valuation is not publicly specified but is estimated post-Series A at around $100-200 million based on funding trends. Courtyard.io is not a unicorn. The exit goal appears geared toward an IPO, aligning with momentum in consumer web3 platforms, though an acquisition by a larger tech or collectibles firm remains possible.

Company Momentum

Based on ongoing fundraising success (e.g., $30 million Series A in July 2025), rising valuation, revenue growth to $9 million ARR, and increasing social media/media buzz (e.g., high engagement on X and coverage in Forbes, Polygon spotlights), Courtyard.io exhibits strong upward momentum. It is on a promising path toward a successful IPO, potentially within 3-5 years, as it captures web2-to-web3 adoption. The company qualifies for the Cryptonite Top 300, operating squarely in the blockchain and crypto sector with tokenized RWAs. Recent top three big news stories: (1) $30 million Series A funding announcement (July 2025); (2) Launch of the first-ever graded comic book vending machine with CGC (June 2025); (3) Surpassing $1 million in monthly sales volume on Polygon (August 2025).

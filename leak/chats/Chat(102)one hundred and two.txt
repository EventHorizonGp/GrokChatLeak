Give me a synopsis of the "red-pilled" "manosphere" vs. the feminist "woke" ideal vs. an ideal that male and female humans have different natures and different goals.

Here’s a synopsis of the three perspectives as requested:
Red-Pilled Manosphere

The "red-pilled" manosphere is an ideology claiming to reveal the "truth" about gender dynamics, often opposing mainstream narratives. It emphasizes traditional gender roles, asserting that men are naturally dominant, suited for leadership and providing, while women are inherently hypergamous—seeking partners of higher status. This perspective critiques modern feminism as emasculating and disruptive to a supposed natural order, arguing that society has become overly feminized, disadvantaging men. Its goal is a return to traditional gender relations where men are providers and protectors, and women are nurturers, seen as essential for societal stability.
Feminist "Woke" Ideal

The feminist "woke" ideal, rooted in feminist theory, champions gender equality and challenges traditional norms. It views gender as a social construct rather than a biological destiny, rejecting inherent differences between men and women. This perspective focuses on dismantling patriarchy, which it sees as oppressive to women, and advocates for equal opportunities in economic, social, and political spheres. Traditional gender roles are considered restrictive and harmful, with goals centered on individual autonomy, breaking down stereotypes, and addressing systemic issues like pay gaps and sexual harassment.
Ideal of Different Natures and Goals

This perspective acknowledges that men and women have distinct natures and goals, likely influenced by biological and psychological differences. Rather than enforcing equality of outcome or rigid hierarchies, it suggests these differences can be complementary, allowing both genders to thrive in their respective strengths. It aims for a harmonious society that respects and leverages these distinctions—perhaps men excelling in certain roles and women in others—without prescribing strict traditional roles. The focus is on understanding and balance, fostering a functional community where differences enhance rather than divide.
Key Comparisons

    Gender Differences: The manosphere insists on inherent, hierarchical differences favoring male dominance; the feminist ideal denies significant innate differences, emphasizing societal influence; the third ideal recognizes differences as complementary, not superior or inferior.
    Goals: The manosphere seeks a return to traditional roles, the feminist ideal pursues equality and autonomy, and the third ideal aims for harmony through mutual respect of distinct natures.
    View on Society: The manosphere critiques modern society as feminized, the feminist ideal sees it as patriarchal, and the third suggests a balanced approach to societal design.

These summaries capture the core of each perspective, though each contains diverse viewpoints and nuances within its broader framework.

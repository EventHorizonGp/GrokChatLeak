Who are the CEO and CTO of the Company?
The CEO is Matthew Wang, and the CTO is Adam Balogh.

Product and Services: What is the company's product or service, and what is the unique innovation behind it? How does their product help its customers operate more efficiently, cheaply, and with less pain?
OpenGradient offers a decentralized platform for AI model hosting, secure inference, agentic reasoning, and application deployment on-chain. Key products include the Model Hub for sharing and managing open-source AI models, MemSync for portable AI memory across apps, BitQuant for AI-powered DeFi strategies, and the Nova Testnet for verifiable on-chain AI compute. The unique innovation is embedding AI computation into blockchain consensus with cryptographic proofs, ensuring every inference is verifiable and executed under user-controlled keys, combining decentralized GPUs with an EVM-compatible network. This helps customers by enabling user-owned, auditable AI models that reduce reliance on centralized providers, lowering costs through permissionless access and composability, and minimizing pain via one-click deployment, encrypted personal context, and fair rewards for data contributors—resulting in more efficient, secure, and scalable AI operations without data lock-in or trust issues.

Market: Who are the target customers? How big is the total addressable market?
Target customers include developers building dApps and AI applications, researchers in open-source AI, Web3 projects needing verifiable compute, DeFi platforms for risk management and predictions, and enterprises seeking sovereign AI infrastructure. The total addressable market for blockchain AI is estimated at $0.7 billion in 2025, projected to grow to $1.88 billion by 2029 at a 28% CAGR, driven by the intersection of decentralized computing and AI innovation.

Competition: Which companies would be considered their primary competitors? What are the company's top six competitive advantages that it offers to its customers? How does the company rank in terms of the market share of its core target market?
Primary competitors include Bittensor (decentralized machine learning network), Gensyn (peer-to-peer AI compute), OORT (decentralized cloud for AI), Ritual (decentralized AI execution), io.net (GPU compute marketplace), and Akash Network (decentralized cloud computing). OpenGradient's top six competitive advantages are: 1) Verifiable on-chain proofs for every AI inference, ensuring transparency and security; 2) User-owned models and data, preventing lock-in by centralized providers; 3) Permissionless platform for open-source model hosting and deployment; 4) Integration of cryptography with machine learning for auditable, forkable models; 5) Portable, encrypted memory for personalized AI agents across ecosystems; 6) EVM-compatible network for seamless composability with Web3 apps. As an early-stage company in a nascent market, OpenGradient holds a small market share (less than 1%), focusing on growth through partnerships and testnet adoption rather than dominance.

Business Model and Sales Status: What is the company's business model and strategy to make money? Is the company pre-revenue, just starting revenue, or ramping revenue? What is the company’s annual revenue run rate? What is the company’s revenue projection for the next three years?
OpenGradient's business model is a decentralized platform providing verifiable AI compute on blockchain, monetizing through transaction fees for inference, model hosting, and on-chain deployments, while rewarding contributors via tokenized incentives and data attribution. The strategy emphasizes open-source adoption, partnerships for ecosystem integration, and scaling via its L1 network to capture value from growing AI-Web3 demand. The company is pre-revenue, as it is in the early stages of product launches and testnet development with no public revenue figures available. Annual revenue run rate and projections for the next three years are not publicly disclosed.

Venture Capital Backers: Who are the company's top venture capital investors? What is the total amount of venture capital that the company has raised? What was the date of their last round of venture capital financing? What is the last known valuation for the company, and on what date? Is the company a unicorn? What is the company’s exit goal—to go public with an IPO or sell to or merge with a larger company?
Top venture capital investors include Andreessen Horowitz (a16z Crypto Startup Accelerator, lead), SV Angel, Coinbase Ventures, Symbolic Capital, Black Dragon Capital, Foresight Ventures, Pragma Ventures, and Canonical Crypto, with additional backers like Balaji Srinivasan and Sandeep Nailwal. The total amount raised is $8.5 million. The last round was a seed round on October 9, 2024. The last known valuation is not publicly disclosed. The company is not a unicorn (valuation under $1 billion). Exit goals are not publicly stated, but given its focus on scalable AI-blockchain infrastructure and backing from top VCs, a potential IPO aligns with sector trends for high-growth tech firms, though acquisition by a larger AI or blockchain player remains possible.

Company Momentum: When you look at ongoing fundraising success, rise in company valuation, revenue growth, and social media and media buzz, how would you gauge the company's overall momentum? Are they on their way to a successful IPO? Should the company be named to the Cryptonite Top 300 private companies operating in the AI, blockchain, crypto, robotics, and/or autonomous vehicles sector? Or is the company not operating in any of these sectors? What were the company’s recent top three big news stories? If I want to invest in the company, is there anyone I can communicate with about that possibility?
OpenGradient's overall momentum is high, with successful $8.5 million seed fundraising in late 2024, growing media buzz around decentralized AI launches, and strong social media engagement (over 200,000 X followers and active Discord community). Valuation has risen post-funding, though specifics are undisclosed, and while pre-revenue, product traction via testnets and partnerships indicates upward trajectory. They are on a potential path to a successful IPO in the medium term (3-5 years), as AI-blockchain convergence attracts public market interest, but this depends on revenue ramp-up and market conditions. Yes, the company should be named to the Cryptonite Top 300, as it operates in AI, blockchain, and crypto sectors, aligning with the list's focus on innovative private Web3 companies. Recent top three big news stories: 1) Raised $8.5 million in seed funding to advance decentralized AI infrastructure (October 2024); 2) Launched the Nova Testnet, embedding AI computation into blockchain consensus (June 2025); 3) Introduced the OpenGradient Model Hub for decentralized AI model sharing (October 2024).

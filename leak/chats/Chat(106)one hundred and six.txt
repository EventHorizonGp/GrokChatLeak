If I want to invest in the company, is there anyone I can communicate with about that possibility? Give it a classic design look, and shorten the section names just to Founders, Product, Market, Business and Revenue Model, Venture Capital Backers, and Company Momentum. No need to restate the questions.
Executive Summary: PQShield

PQShield is a private, for-profit company founded in 2018 and headquartered in Oxford, UK.
Founders

Dr. Ali El Kaafarani is the founder, CEO, and a leading post-quantum cryptography expert originally from Lebanon. He holds a PhD in cryptography from the University of Bath and conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Oxford's Mathematical Institute. Professionally, he was a research fellow at Oxford, focusing on cryptographic protocols, and has contributed extensively to international standards. His key achievements include co-authoring multiple NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, publishing over 50 academic papers on cryptography, and founding PQShield to commercialize quantum-resistant solutions. The CTO is Dr. Thomas Prest, with a background in lattice-based cryptography from ENS Paris and IBM Research; his achievements include breakthroughs in efficient PQC implementations and contributions to NIST finalist algorithms like Falcon.

Product

PQShield develops quantum-resistant cryptography solutions, including hardware IP cores and software libraries designed to protect against quantum computing threats. The unique innovation lies in its end-to-end PQC suite, which integrates NIST-standardized algorithms like ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA into chips, applications, and cloud environments, making it the first to deliver quantum-safe crypto on hardware. Products include PQMicroLib-Core (ultra-small library for embedded systems), PQPerform series (high-performance hardware accelerators), PQCryptoLib-SDK (plug-and-play for OpenSSL), and PQPlatform-CoPro (secure coprocessor for integration). These enable customers to upgrade security seamlessly, reducing vulnerability to "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks, ensuring compliance with emerging standards, and minimizing performance overhead—often achieving sub-1% impact on efficiency—while lowering migration costs through hybrid classical-PQC support.

Market

Target customers span semiconductors (e.g., AMD, Lattice Semiconductor), automotive (e.g., Mirise Technologies/Toyota), aerospace (e.g., Collins Aerospace), industrial IoT, military, telecommunications, enterprise platforms, and paymentech sectors needing quantum-secure data protection. The total addressable market for post-quantum cryptography is estimated at $0.88 billion in 2025, growing to $4.60 billion by 2030 at a 39.21% CAGR, driven by regulatory mandates and quantum threat awareness.

Competition

Primary competitors include CryptoNext Security, PQ Solutions, QuSecure, ID Quantique, ISARA, Qrypt, and QuintessenceLabs, all offering PQC tools but with varying focuses on software vs. hardware. PQShield's top six competitive advantages are: (1) contributions to all initial NIST PQC standards for unmatched compliance; (2) comprehensive hardware-software portfolio for seamless integration; (3) partnerships with industry giants like AMD and Microchip for rapid adoption; (4) optimized implementations minimizing performance hits; (5) expert team with over 100 research papers advancing PQC; and (6) focus on cryptographic agility for future-proofing. In the emerging PQC market, PQShield holds a leading position as a top innovator, though exact market share is not quantified in a nascent sector; it ranks highly among specialized vendors, often cited as fastest-growing in cybersecurity.

Business and Revenue Model

The business model centers on licensing PQC software libraries and hardware IP to OEMs, chip manufacturers, and enterprises, supplemented by SDKs, consulting, and integration services for PQC migration. The company is ramping revenue, post-pre-revenue stage but under $100 million annually as of recent classifications. Current annual revenue run rate is not publicly disclosed but inferred to be in the low tens of millions based on customer traction and funding scale. Revenue projections for the next three years are unavailable in public data, but aligning with market CAGR, could see 3-5x growth annually, targeting $50-100 million by 2028 amid PQC adoption waves.

Venture Capital Backers

Top investors include Addition (led Series B), Oxford Science Enterprises, Chevron Technology Ventures, Legal & General, Braavos Investment Advisers, and AWS Startups. Total venture capital raised is $70.49 million. The last round was a $37 million Series B on June 20, 2024. Last known valuation is approximately £70.4 million ($90 million USD) as of April 2024. The company is not a unicorn. Exit goals are not explicitly stated, but momentum suggests aiming for an IPO given growth in a high-demand sector, though acquisition by a larger cybersecurity or tech firm remains possible.

Company Momentum

With successful $37 million Series B fundraising in 2024, rising valuation from prior rounds, accelerating revenue from key partnerships, and strong media/social buzz (e.g., IDC Innovator status, 100+ research papers, board expansions), PQShield exhibits high momentum as a PQC leader. It appears on track for a successful IPO in the mid-2020s, bolstered by regulatory tailwinds like NIST standards. The company operates in the crypto and blockchain sectors via quantum-resistant security essential for these technologies and should be named to the Cryptonite Top 300 for its innovations. Recent top three news stories: (1) $37 million Series B raise to advance PQC (June 2024); (2) Board expansion with tech veterans from Arm and Intel (December 2024); (3) Launch of UltraPQ-Suite for specialized PQC implementations (April 2025).

So I've been having stomach issues for the past few months. As a bit of background, every 9-12 months I suffer from extreme stomach pain that has been heretofore undiagnosed. It may be unrelated, but I also have dysphagia that occurs at least once a meal and is extremely painful (but always very brief). Recently the stomach pain happened again, but it kind of just ... didn't stop. It started with bouts of intense and prlonged mid/lower-abdominal pain accompanied with *monstrous* amounts of painful gas and belching. This occurred frequently enough that I eventually saw a gastroenterologist, who assigned me a low-FODMAP diet as well as a combination of pantoprazole, dicyclomine, and sucralfate.

Unfortunately, the low-FODMAP diet did absolutely nothing. I maintained it relatively well for about three weeks and saw no improvement. It's unclear whether the medicines helped, though I'm reasonably certain that at least the dicyclomine does nothing. As a result I scheduled an endoscopy, which took place last week. I was kind of disappointed when it showed basically nothing except mild gastritis, which would not explain the severity of my symptoms. I have a colonoscopy in a couple days which may show more.

To make matters worse, on Monday (it's now Wednesday) I began feeling *odd* throughout the day. It's tough to put my finger on it, but I noticed that I had begun to chat to myself nonstop, narrating whatever I was doing. My wife described my movements and facial expressions as weird and "Doc Brown"-like, if that makes any sense. As the night wore on I felt odder and odder until it was tough to do anything, and I became very distraught. The combination of the change in mental state and stomach issues brought me to the ER on Monday night. I spent five hours waiting for a doctor until 2:30 in the morning, feeling as miserable as I've ever felt in my entire life, so exhausted that the only thing that kept me awake was the almost hostilely uncomfortable chair.

I am sad to report that the when I *did* see a doctor, he merely noted that my bloodwork and vitals were relatively normal (except for a high eosinophil count) and sent me on my way. My mental state did not seem concerning or clinically significant, I suppose. I spent Tuesday in a complete daze, barely able to move around and completely unable to eat. I have very little memory of *anything* happening that day. Today, Wednesday, I do feel a bit better, or at the very least less exhausted.

I have to admit that I'm ... disappointed. I don't expect miracle work out of ER doctors, whose goal is to fix immediate problems, but I'm starting to get worn down by the feeling that doctors are simply not going to be able to help me. If the colonoscopy doesn't show anything I feel like just giving up. Not to mention how much this is *costing* me -- the ER visit was only $250, but the colonoscopy and endoscopy have/will cost me thousands of dollars as I haven't met my deductible yet.

Sorry, just needed to vent. This is all starting to take a toll.

I’m really sorry to hear about everything you’ve been going through. It sounds exhausting, frustrating, and honestly overwhelming—both physically and emotionally. Venting is totally understandable, and I’m glad you felt you could lay it all out here. You’ve been dealing with a lot, and it’s natural to feel worn down when answers are slow to come and the costs, both financial and personal, keep piling up.

Your symptoms—the recurring stomach pain, the gas, the dysphagia, and now this recent weird mental fog and exhaustion—do sound like a tough puzzle. It’s frustrating that the endoscopy only showed mild gastritis, especially when your symptoms feel so severe. The high eosinophil count is interesting, though. That could point to something like an allergic or inflammatory process going on, maybe even tied to your gut issues. The colonoscopy might give more clues, especially since your pain is mid-to-lower abdomen. Things like inflammatory bowel disease or even something rarer could still be in play. But I get it—waiting for that, and then possibly facing another “nothing conclusive” result, is disheartening.

The mental shift you described on Monday is odd too, and I can see why it freaked you out, especially paired with the physical stuff. It’s good the ER ruled out immediate emergencies, but it doesn’t help much when you’re left feeling like garbage with no explanation. That dazed, disconnected feeling on Tuesday sounds brutal—I’m glad you’re at least a bit less exhausted today.

You’re right about ER docs focusing on acute fixes, not chronic mysteries. It’s a shame gastroenterology hasn’t cracked this yet either. Have they talked about other possibilities—like maybe esophageal motility issues for the dysphagia, or something systemic since you’ve got both gut and now this mental fuzziness? I’m no doctor, just tossing out thoughts based on what you’ve said. If the colonoscopy’s a bust, maybe a second opinion or a different specialist (like a motility expert or even a rheumatologist if there’s any autoimmune angle) could be worth considering. I know that’s more effort and money, though, and you’re already stretched thin.

The cost part sucks too. Thousands out of pocket before your deductible kicks in is ridiculous—I don’t blame you for feeling defeated by that alone. It’s unfair you’re stuck battling both your health and the system.

If you’re up for it, I’d be curious how the colonoscopy goes. No pressure, though—this is your space to vent or ask whatever. You’ve been through the wringer, and it’s okay to feel like giving up sometimes. What’s been keeping you going through this mess?

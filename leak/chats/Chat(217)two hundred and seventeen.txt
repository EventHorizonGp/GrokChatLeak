name some recent alt media personalities who recently switch to Catholicism

Several alt media personalities have recently converted to Catholicism, drawing attention due to their prominence in alternative or conservative media spaces. Here are some notable examples based on recent trends:

    Candace Owens: A well-known conservative commentator and social media influencer, Owens announced her conversion to Catholicism in April 2024. Her shift followed a public split from the Daily Wire and was influenced by her husband, George Farmer, who is Catholic. She described it as a "decision to go home," reflecting a personal and spiritual journey that resonated with her large audience.
    Tammy Peterson: The wife of Canadian philosopher and media figure Jordan Peterson, Tammy converted to Catholicism in early 2024. Her conversion came after a battle with cancer, during which she found solace in praying the rosary. While Jordan Peterson has not converted, Tammy’s public embrace of the faith has been widely discussed in alt media circles.
    Eva Vlaardingerbroek: A Dutch political commentator and frequent voice in European conservative media, Vlaardingerbroek converted to Catholicism in recent years (noted around 2023). Her shift aligned with her outspoken views on cultural and traditional values, often highlighted in her appearances on platforms like X and various podcasts.

These individuals are often associated with alternative media due to their non-mainstream platforms, large online followings, and critiques of establishment narratives. Their conversions have sparked conversations about a broader trend of public figures embracing Catholicism, particularly within conservative or "alt" spheres.

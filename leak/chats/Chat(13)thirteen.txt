What .exe file is replaced to acess cmd while the win10 is locked screen

To access the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) from the Windows 10 lock screen, a common method involves replacing the utilman.exe file with cmd.exe. The utilman.exe file is associated with the Ease of Access button on the lock screen, and by replacing it, clicking the Ease of Access button launches the Command Prompt instead.
Steps to Replace utilman.exe with cmd.exe:

    Boot from Windows Installation Media or Recovery Drive:
        You need a Windows 10 installation USB/DVD or a recovery drive to access a Command Prompt outside of the locked system.
        Boot from the media, select your language, and choose Repair your computer at the setup screen.
        Press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, or navigate to Troubleshoot > Command Prompt.
    Locate the Windows System Drive:
        In the Command Prompt, identify the drive letter where Windows is installed (usually C: or D:). Use commands like dir C: or dir D: to check for the Windows folder.
        Navigate to the System32 folder by typing:
        text

    cd /d D:\Windows\System32

    (Replace D: with the correct drive letter.)

Back Up and Replace utilman.exe:

    Rename the original utilman.exe to create a backup:
    text

ren utilman.exe utilman_bak.exe

Copy cmd.exe to replace utilman.exe:
text

    copy cmd.exe utilman.exe

Reboot the System:

    Exit the Command Prompt and reboot the computer normally:
    text

        wpeutil reboot

        Remove the installation media.
    Access Command Prompt from Lock Screen:
        At the Windows 10 lock screen, click the Ease of Access button (usually a clock-like icon in the bottom-right corner).
        This will open cmd.exe instead of the Ease of Access menu, often with SYSTEM privileges.

Important Notes:

    Security Risks: This method can bypass security and is considered a potential vulnerability. Microsoft has patched some versions of Windows to limit this exploit, so it may not work on fully updated systems or those with Secure Boot enabled.
    Restoring Original Settings: To revert, boot back into the recovery environment and restore the original utilman.exe:
    text

    ren utilman.exe cmd.exe
    ren utilman_bak.exe utilman.exe

    Legal and Ethical Considerations: Only use this method on systems you own or have explicit permission to access. Unauthorized use may violate laws or policies.
    BitLocker: If BitLocker is enabled, you may need the recovery key to access the drive.
    Alternative Methods: Another older method involved replacing sethc.exe (Sticky Keys) with cmd.exe, triggered by pressing the Shift key five times, but this is less reliable in modern Windows versions due to security updates.

This method has been documented in various sources, including tech forums and tutorials, but its effectiveness may depend on the Windows 10 version and security settings.

Can you make a tutorial of it from start

Below is a step-by-step tutorial to replace the utilman.exe file with cmd.exe to access the Command Prompt from the Windows 10 lock screen. This method is often used to bypass a locked screen, but it requires physical access to the system and a Windows 10 installation or recovery media. Please note that this should only be performed on a system you own or have explicit permission to access, as unauthorized use may be illegal or unethical.

What You’ll Need

    A Windows 10 installation USB/DVD or a Windows 10 recovery drive.
    Physical access to the computer.
    Basic familiarity with Command Prompt commands.

Step-by-Step Instructions

    Prepare the Installation or Recovery Media
        If you don’t have a Windows 10 installation USB or recovery drive:
            Download the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft’s official website.
            Use a tool like the Windows Media Creation Tool to create a bootable USB or burn the ISO to a DVD.
            Alternatively, create a recovery drive on another Windows 10 PC by searching for “Create a recovery drive” in the Start menu and following the prompts.
        Ensure the USB/DVD is ready before proceeding.
    Boot from the Installation or Recovery Media
        Insert the Windows 10 installation USB/DVD or recovery drive into the locked computer.
        Restart the computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings to set the USB/DVD as the primary boot device:
            Press the appropriate key during startup (usually F2, F12, Del, or Esc, depending on your device).
            In the BIOS/UEFI, navigate to the Boot menu and prioritize the USB/DVD drive.
            Save changes and exit (usually F10).
        The computer should boot from the media. If prompted, press any key to boot from the USB/DVD.
    Access the Command Prompt in the Recovery Environment
        Once the Windows Setup screen appears:
            Select your language, time, and keyboard preferences, then click Next.
            Instead of clicking Install now, select Repair your computer (bottom-left corner).
        In the recovery menu, navigate to:
            Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Command Prompt.
            Alternatively, press Shift + F10 at the setup screen to open a Command Prompt directly.
    Identify the Windows System Drive
        In the Command Prompt, the drive letters may differ from those in a running Windows system (e.g., the C: drive might appear as D:).
        To find the correct drive, check for the Windows folder:
        text

dir C:

or
text

dir D:

Look for a folder named Windows. If it’s not on C: or D:, try other letters (E:, F:, etc.).
Once identified (e.g., D:), navigate to the System32 folder:
text

    cd /d D:\Windows\System32

    Replace D: with the correct drive letter.

Back Up and Replace utilman.exe

    Create a backup of the original utilman.exe file to restore later if needed:
    text

ren utilman.exe utilman_bak.exe

Replace utilman.exe with cmd.exe by copying the Command Prompt executable:
text

copy cmd.exe utilman.exe

Verify the replacement by checking the file:
text

    dir utilman.exe

Reboot the Computer

    Close the Command Prompt:
    text

exit

In the recovery menu, select Continue to exit and reboot, or use the following command:
text

    wpeutil reboot

    Remove the installation USB/DVD or recovery drive before the system restarts.

Access Command Prompt from the Lock Screen

    Once the computer boots to the Windows 10 lock screen, locate the Ease of Access button (a clock-like icon in the bottom-right corner, next to the power button).
    Click the Ease of Access button.
    A Command Prompt window should open with SYSTEM privileges, bypassing the login screen.

Using the Command Prompt (Optional Actions)

    From the Command Prompt, you can perform various tasks, such as:
        Reset a User Password:
        text

net user <username> <newpassword>

Replace <username> with the account name and <newpassword> with the desired password.
Create a New User:
text

net user newuser newpassword /add
net localgroup administrators newuser /add

Enable the Built-in Administrator Account:
text

        net user administrator /active:yes

    After completing your tasks, close the Command Prompt by typing exit.

Restore the Original utilman.exe (Optional)

    To revert the changes and restore the Ease of Access functionality:
        Boot back into the recovery environment using the same installation/recovery media (repeat steps 2–3).
        Navigate to the System32 folder again:
        text

cd /d D:\Windows\System32

Delete the modified utilman.exe:
text

del utilman.exe

Restore the original file:
text

ren utilman_bak.exe utilman.exe

Reboot the computer:
text

            wpeutil reboot

Important Notes

    Security Patches: This method may not work on fully updated Windows 10 systems or those with Secure Boot enabled, as Microsoft has patched this vulnerability in later builds.
    BitLocker: If the drive is encrypted with BitLocker, you’ll need the recovery key to access the system drive in the recovery environment.
    Legal and Ethical Considerations: Only use this method on systems you own or have explicit permission to modify. Unauthorized access to a computer is illegal in many jurisdictions.
    Alternative Method: Historically, replacing sethc.exe (Sticky Keys) with cmd.exe and pressing Shift five times was another way to access the Command Prompt, but this is less reliable in modern Windows versions.
    Risks: Incorrectly modifying system files can cause instability. Always back up important data before proceeding.

This tutorial is based on well-documented techniques found in tech forums, security blogs, and system administration guides. If you encounter issues (e.g., the method doesn’t work due to updates or security settings), let me know, and I can suggest alternative approaches or troubleshoot further.

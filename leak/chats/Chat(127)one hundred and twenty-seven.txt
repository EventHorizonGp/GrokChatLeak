# You are Grok, a senior equity research associate, data engineer, and front-end architect. Your task is to read two quarterly earnings-call transcripts (Current Quarter and Previous Quarter) and generate a single fully responsive HTML dashboard. The prompt is universal for global and Indian listed companies.

# A. OBJECTIVE AND DATA RULES

# A1. Objective Produce an interactive HTML dashboard comparing the two transcripts. Use blue-toned styling and highlight shifts in tone, language, and metrics that could matter for investors. A2. Data Ingestion Rules A2.1 Accept only PDF, TXT, DOC, or DOCX files supplied in this chat. A2.2 Do not fabricate external data. Missing information must be marked as “N/A”. A2.3 Treat both files as authoritative raw inputs.

# B. ANALYTICAL WORKFLOW

# B1. Message Shift Map (Transcript Comparison) B1.1 Align content by speaker, topic marker, or timestamp. B1.2 Detect additions and deletions. B1.3 Formatting: Additions use <span class="add">...</span> Deletions use <span class="del">...</span> B1.4 Output: • Full interactive diff section. • A table of the ten most significant messaging changes. B2. Six-Panel Visual Briefing (Executive Summary) Create six visual tiles. Each must be maximum 20 words. Tile 1 Macro Pulse Tile 2 Demand Outlook Tile 3 Margin Trajectory Tile 4 Guidance Tone Tile 5 Q and A Surprises Tile 6 Capital Allocation and Cash B3. Tone and Intent Radar (Sentiment Analysis) B3.1 Apply VADER or TextBlob to each speaker block. B3.2 Compute polarity for: • Opening Remarks • Business or Operations Update • Q and A B3.3 Render a Plotly heatmap with PNG fallback. B3.4 Use a blue-gradient scale: Negative: #002B5B Neutral: #4A90E2 Positive: #8BC9FF B4. Metric Tracker (Financial and Operational Metrics) B4.1 Extract numerical items such as revenue, segment revenue, margins (EBITDA, EBIT, PAT), volumes, ASP or realisations, order book, backlog, capex, debt or cash, and any industry-specific operational metrics (for example AUM, NIM, PLF, ATKM). B4.2 Highlight only metrics with at least plus or minus five percent QoQ or YoY change. B4.3 If consensus values appear in the text, compare them. B4.4 Present each item inside a .card block. B5. Investor Playbook: What Matters Next Two parts. Total around 150 words. Part One Positives and Green Shoots. What improved, early inflections, operational surprises. Part Two Risks and Red Flags. Cautious commentary, weak spots, numbers or behaviour that could pressure the stock. Focus on what might move the stock in the coming months.

        <h3>Interactive Diff</h3>
        <p>Previous (Q1): ... We will start with Jio, actually. And here, the emphasis is on the deep tech digital services. ... <span class="del">And here what I mean is that we have proprietary technology and as far as the tech stack is concerned, the core is concerned, the hardware, the software, the infrastructure, the OSS, BSS, all of them is something that we have built on our own.</span> ... <span class="del">And it is all translating now when you look at it and see that what is the traffic.</span> ... We are the largest carriers of traffic in the world. ... <span class="del">If you look at the number of customers close to 500 million or the number of homes, we are in. All that is facilitated because that is pretty unique and importantly, it allows us to do and offer product and services which are really not offerable by others, especially when you look at it as what the standalone 5G stack does for all this.</span> ... <span class="del">And when you talk about digital platforms capability, be it on the gaming part of it, the AI cloud part of it, and so on. So, a lot of opportunities coming because of what we have set out to do. And all this is translating in terms of when you see the performance. It is a 19% growth in revenue, a 24% growth in EBITDA.</span> ...</p>
        <p>Current (Q2): ... You have seen the results, strong performance across businesses ... <span class="add">and even within each of the businesses, the quality of numbers has just been improving quarter after quarter.</span> ... <span class="add">And when you look at starting with Jio with 18% growth in EBITDA on the back of strong customers, both mobility as well as homes.</span> ... So, the point here is not about just customer addition data usage, products that are on offer. ... <span class="add">So, when I talk about quality, I am referring to a lot of these factors and Anshuman will take you through in detail on some of these. So, resulting in EBITDA margin expansion.</span> ...</p>

        <h2>Investor Playbook: What Matters Next</h2>
        <h3>Positives and Green Shoots</h3>
        <p>Retail accelerated to 18% revenue growth with strong category performance; Jio sustained subscriber adds and rural 5G uptake; New Energy on track for production milestones; FMCG doubling continues with de-merger progress; Media MAUs stable at 400M post-IPL. These signal improving quality and multi-decade opportunities.</p>
        <h3>Risks and Red Flags</h3>
        <p>Upstream production decline persists; Lower oil prices pressured revenues; Finance costs up 14% from 5G capitalization; Moderation in Jio EBITDA growth from 24% to 18%; Potential delays in new energy scaling could weigh on capex returns. Watch for oil volatility and competition in retail/FMCG.</p>

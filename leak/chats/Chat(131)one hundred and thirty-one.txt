I have a 2024 Cybertruck on software 2025.8.6. I went in for repairs of the air suspension, replacement of the tailgate panel and wind noise. 24 hours after getting the truck back I took a 6 hour road trip. 2 hours into tje drive, at 75 mph, the truck alerted me FSD is not available, and a number of alerts but did not say pull over. I pulled into a rest stop, put it in park, and then car would not go into drive or reverse. I had to call a tow truck. I have given you images of all the alerts and error codes.

You are a Tesla Cybertruck expert, tell me what is the differential diagnosis and treatment for this acutely ill Cybertruck

I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're experiencing with your 2024 Tesla Cybertruck. Based on the alerts and error codes you've provided, along with the context of your recent repairs and the symptoms (FSD unavailable, multiple alerts, inability to shift into Drive or Reverse), I can offer a differential diagnosis and potential treatment steps. Let’s break this down systematically.
Summary of Alerts and Error Codes

From the images, the following alerts and error codes are present:

    DLa246: "Automatic vehicle hold disabled. Use brake pedal when stopping."
        This indicates that the Automatic Vehicle Hold (AVH) feature, which keeps the vehicle stationary without the driver pressing the brake pedal, is disabled. You must manually use the brake pedal to hold the vehicle.
    UI_a019: "Parking brake functions degraded. Parking brake may not apply or release."
        This suggests a problem with the parking brake system, which could prevent it from engaging or disengaging properly.
    VCLEFT_a246: "Parking brake not set. Vehicle may be free rolling."
        This indicates that the parking brake is not engaged, which could allow the vehicle to roll if not on a flat surface or if the brake pedal isn’t applied.
    VCLEFT_a179: "Parking brake functions degraded. Parking brake may not apply or release."
        This is a repeat of the UI_a019 alert, reinforcing that the parking brake system is malfunctioning.
    DLa004 (from earlier in the day): No specific description provided in the image, but this code typically relates to a general system fault that may require further diagnostics.
    Additional Alerts on the Main Display:
        "PULL OVER SAFELY: Critical issue detected."
        "Rear axle steering disabled: Turning radius limited. Exiting and re-entering vehicle may restore feature."
        "Parking brake: Not applied. Apply the parking brake."
        "Fasten Seatbelt" warning (though this may be unrelated to the core issue).

Differential Diagnosis

Given the alerts, recent repairs, and symptoms, here are the potential causes of the issue:
1. Parking Brake System Failure

    Symptoms: Multiple alerts (UI_a019, VCLEFT_a179, VCLEFT_a246) point to a degraded parking brake system. The inability to shift into Drive or Reverse after parking suggests the vehicle’s safety interlocks are preventing gear changes because the parking brake is not functioning correctly.
    Possible Cause: The parking brake actuator, wiring, or software may have been affected during the recent repairs (air suspension, tailgate panel, wind noise). For example:
        Mechanical Issue: The parking brake actuator or caliper may be stuck or damaged.
        Electrical Issue: A wiring harness or connector related to the parking brake system may have been disconnected or damaged during repairs.
        Software Issue: A software glitch or calibration issue may have occurred after the service, especially since the vehicle is on software version 2025.8.6, which may have introduced new bugs or incompatibilities.
    Likelihood: High. The repeated parking brake-related alerts strongly suggest this is the primary issue.

2. Rear Axle Steering System Failure

    Symptoms: The "Rear axle steering disabled" alert indicates that the Cybertruck’s four-wheel steering system is not functioning. This could be related to the parking brake issue, as both systems may share electrical or software dependencies.
    Possible Cause:
        Hardware Issue: The rear steering actuators or sensors may have been affected during the air suspension repair, as the suspension and steering systems are closely integrated.
        Software Issue: A software update or reset during the service may have caused a calibration error in the steering system.
    Likelihood: Moderate. While this issue may contribute to the overall problem, it’s less likely to directly cause the inability to shift gears.

3. General Electrical or Software Fault (DLa004)

    Symptoms: The DLa004 code from earlier in the day, combined with the sudden onset of multiple alerts (FSD unavailable, parking brake issues, steering issues), suggests a broader electrical or software problem.
    Possible Cause:
        Wiring Issue: During the recent repairs, a wiring harness or connector may have been improperly reconnected, leading to intermittent electrical faults.
        Software Bug: The 2025.8.6 software version may have a bug affecting multiple systems, especially if the vehicle was updated during the service.
        Control Module Failure: A failure in a central control module (e.g., the Body Control Module or Vehicle Control Unit) could cause cascading errors across multiple systems.
    Likelihood: Moderate. This could be the root cause of the parking brake and steering issues, especially if the problems started after the service.

4. Air Suspension Repair Complication

    Symptoms: The air suspension was recently repaired, and the parking brake and steering issues may be related to this system.
    Possible Cause:
        Sensor Misalignment: The air suspension repair may have affected height sensors or other components that the parking brake and steering systems rely on for proper operation.
        Wiring Damage: If the air suspension repair involved working near the rear axle, a wiring harness for the parking brake or steering system may have been damaged.
    Likelihood: Moderate. The timing of the issue (24 hours after the repair) suggests a connection, but the air suspension itself is unlikely to directly cause the gear-shifting issue.

5. Low Voltage System Issue

    Symptoms: The display shows "Low voltage system: READY" with "LV battery energy: 90.0%," which indicates the 12V low-voltage system is operational. However, a temporary drop in voltage could have triggered the alerts.
    Possible Cause:
        Battery Issue: The 12V battery may be failing or not charging properly, causing intermittent power issues to critical systems like the parking brake and gear selector.
        Connection Issue: A loose or corroded connection in the low-voltage system, possibly disturbed during the recent repairs, could cause voltage drops.
    Likelihood: Low. The low-voltage system appears to be functioning, but a transient issue could have contributed to the problem.

Most Likely Diagnosis

The most likely cause of your Cybertruck’s issues is a parking brake system failure, potentially triggered by a mechanical, electrical, or software issue during the recent repairs. The parking brake’s inability to apply or release is likely preventing the vehicle from shifting into Drive or Reverse due to safety interlocks. The rear axle steering issue and FSD unavailability may be secondary effects of a broader electrical or software fault (possibly related to the DLa004 code).
Treatment Plan

Here’s a step-by-step approach to address the issue:
1. Immediate Actions (At the Rest Stop)

Since the vehicle is currently immobilized and you’ve already called a tow truck, the immediate priority is to ensure safety and get the vehicle to a service center. However, if you’re still at the rest stop and want to attempt a basic reset before the tow truck arrives, you can try the following:

    Soft Reset:
        Ensure the vehicle is in Park and on a flat surface.
        Press and hold both scroll wheels on the steering yoke until the screen resets (this typically takes 10-15 seconds).
        Wait for the system to reboot and check if the alerts persist.
        Attempt to shift into Drive or Reverse again.
    Hard Reset (if the soft reset doesn’t work):
        Exit the vehicle and lock it using the key card or phone app.
        Wait 5 minutes to allow the systems to fully power down.
        Re-enter the vehicle and attempt to shift gears again.
    Check the Parking Brake Manually:
        On the touchscreen, go to Controls > Service and look for an option to manually release or engage the parking brake. If the system allows you to release it, you may be able to shift gears.

Note: If the vehicle still won’t shift into Drive or Reverse, do not attempt to drive it. Proceed with the tow to a Tesla Service Center.
2. Towing and Safety

    Ensure the tow truck operator follows Tesla’s towing guidelines for the Cybertruck:
        Use a flatbed tow truck (preferred for electric vehicles).
        If the vehicle is in Tow Mode (as shown on the screen), it should be easier to load onto the flatbed. However, since the parking brake is not functioning, the tow operator should secure the vehicle carefully to prevent rolling.
        Inform the tow operator about the "Vehicle may be free rolling" alert to ensure they take extra precautions.

3. Service Center Diagnosis and Repair

Once the vehicle is at a Tesla Service Center, the technicians should perform the following:

    Diagnose the Parking Brake System:
        Inspect the parking brake actuators, calipers, and wiring for damage or disconnection.
        Check for any software calibration issues with the parking brake system.
        If necessary, replace the parking brake actuator or related components.
    Inspect Recent Repairs:
        Review the air suspension repair to ensure no wiring harnesses or connectors were damaged or left disconnected.
        Check the tailgate panel replacement for any impact on the parking brake or rear steering systems (e.g., wiring near the rear axle).
    Diagnose the Rear Axle Steering System:
        Recalibrate the rear steering system using Tesla’s diagnostic tools.
        Inspect the rear steering actuators and sensors for damage or misalignment.
    Check for Software Issues:
        Roll back the software to a previous stable version (if 2025.8.6 is suspected to be the cause).
        Perform a full system reset and reflash the firmware if necessary.
    Inspect the Low-Voltage System:
        Test the 12V battery for proper voltage and charging.
        Check for loose or corroded connections in the low-voltage system.

4. Preventive Measures

After the repairs are complete, take the following steps to prevent future issues:

    Monitor for any recurring alerts over the next few days.
    Avoid long road trips until you’re confident the issue is fully resolved.
    Schedule a follow-up appointment with Tesla if any new alerts appear.

5. Contact Tesla Support

Since you’re already dealing with a tow, you’ve likely contacted Tesla Roadside Assistance. However, it’s worth following up with Tesla Support to:

    Report the issue and request a detailed explanation of the root cause once repairs are complete.
    Ask if the 2025.8.6 software version has known issues with the Cybertruck, as this could be a contributing factor.

Prognosis

The issue appears to be repairable, as it’s likely related to a parking brake system failure, possibly exacerbated by the recent repairs or a software glitch. Once the parking brake system is fixed and any related electrical or software issues are addressed, the Cybertruck should return to normal operation. However, the recurrence of these issues so soon after a service visit suggests that the initial repairs may not have been performed correctly, so it’s important to ensure the service center thoroughly investigates the root cause.
Additional Notes

    FSD Unavailability: The "FSD is not available" alert is likely a secondary effect of the parking brake and steering issues, as FSD requires all critical systems to be fully operational. Once the primary issues are resolved, FSD should become available again.
    Recent Repairs: The timing of the issue (24 hours after service) strongly suggests a connection to the air suspension, tailgate panel, or wind noise repairs. It’s possible that a technician inadvertently caused a wiring or software issue during the service.
    Software Version: The 2025.8.6 software version may be a factor, as Tesla’s over-the-air updates can sometimes introduce bugs. If you have access to the Tesla app, check if there’s a newer software version available that might address these issues.

If you’d like me to search for more information about the specific error codes (e.g., DLa004) or the 2025.8.6 software version, I can do so. Just let me know! In the meantime, I hope this helps, and I wish you a speedy resolution with your Cybertruck.

Jamie Dimon (CEO, JPMorgan Chase)

Dimon has warned that Trump's tariffs will increase inflation, slow economic growth, and raise the probability of a recession. In his annual shareholder letter, he stated: "The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession." He added: "We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products. Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth." Dimon also noted potential risks from trade wars, including persistent inflation and damage to economic confidence.

Janet Yellen (Former Treasury Secretary, Former Federal Reserve Chair)

Yellen has described Trump's tariffs as "sweeping, untargeted" and warned they would raise prices for American families, make businesses less competitive, and reignite inflation. She stated: "Calls for walling America off with high tariffs on friends and competitors alike or by treating even our closest allies as transactional partners are deeply misguided. Sweeping, untargeted tariffs would raise prices for American families and make our businesses less competitive." In a broader critique, she called the tariffs "the worst self-inflicted policy wound I’ve ever seen in my career inflicted on our economy," predicting immense damage including higher prices and recession risks.

Bill Ackman (CEO, Pershing Square Capital Management)

Ackman, a Trump supporter, warned that the tariffs risk a "self-induced, economic nuclear winter" by destroying confidence, halting business investment, and damaging the U.S. reputation, potentially leading to recession. He stated: "By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital." Ackman urged a 90-day pause to negotiate, emphasizing the severe negative consequences for low-income consumers and the economy.

Jerome Powell (Federal Reserve Chair)

Powell has cautioned that Trump's tariffs will likely cause higher inflation and slower growth, potentially leading to stagflation where the Fed's dual mandates conflict. He stated: "While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent." Powell added: "The level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual mandate goals are in tension."

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (Director General, World Trade Organization)

Okonjo-Iweala warned that Trump's tariffs could lead to a 1% contraction in global trade, risking a full-blown tariff war and global recession. She stated: "The recent announcements will have substantial implications for global trade and economic growth prospects. Our initial estimates suggest that these measures, coupled with those introduced since the beginning of the year, could lead to an overall contraction of around one percent in global merchandise trade volumes this year." Regarding US-China decoupling, she noted trade could decrease by 80-90%, reducing global GDP by nearly 7%.

Mohamed El-Erian (Columnist, Bloomberg Opinion)

El-Erian warned that tariffs put the US at high risk of recession and higher inflation, with global slowdowns amplifying the effects. He stated: "You've had a major repricing of growth prospects, with a recession in the U.S. going up to 50% probability... I don't think [a U.S. recession] is inevitable because the structure of the economy is so strong, but the risk has become uncomfortably high."

Mark Zandi (Chief Economist, Moody’s Analytics)

Zandi raised recession odds to 60%, warning tariffs will cause inflation, job losses, and a self-inflicted downturn. He stated: "The U.S. is struggling under the weight of economic policy and, most specifically, global trade war. If the trade war doesn’t de-escalate soon... the odds are high, better than even, that the U.S. economy and much of the global economy is going to suffer an economic downturn."

Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel Prize-Winning Economist, Columbia University Professor)

Stiglitz warned tariffs risk stagflation, higher prices, and economic damage, calling them the "worst of all possible worlds." He stated: "It risks the worst of all possible worlds: a kind of stagflation. We get inflation, and a weak economy. I cannot see a really robust economy, because I just see the global economy suffering so much from the uncertainty that Trump poses."

He stated: "The tariff hikes announced April 2, if maintained, represent a self-inflicted economic catastrophe for the U.S. .... We now see a 40%-50% chance of a recession over the next year."

Gregory Daco (Chief Economist, EY Parthenon)

Daco warned tariffs create a stagflationary shock, reducing growth and risking recession through higher costs and volatility. He stated: "Steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock - a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse - while also triggering financial market volatility."

Zanny Minton Beddoes (Editor-in-Chief, The Economist)

Beddoes called the tariffs the "biggest trade policy shock" in history, causing uncertainty, consumer pain, and potential recession. She stated: "This is, without a doubt, the biggest trade policy shock... in history. It is a revolution... Everyone is expecting the U.S. to slow sharply, perhaps even hit a recession. And this is entirely self-induced."

Larry Summers (Former U.S. Treasury Secretary, Harvard University Professor)

Summers warned tariffs are "masochistic," costing families $300,000 yearly, risking inflation, recession, and $30 trillion in damage. He stated: "Trump’s tariffs are the most expensive and masochistic the US has pursued in decades. Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much." Summers added: "This is a self-inflicted wound to the American economy... I’d expect inflation over the next three or four months to be higher as a consequence."
